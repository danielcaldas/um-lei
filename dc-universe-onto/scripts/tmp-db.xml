	<short-description>It takes a certain type of villain to get the best of the Bat. It takes another breed entirely to overrun his city, crush his spirits and demolish him completely. It takes a person of incredible intelligence. A person of immeasurable resolve. A person of insurmountable strength. A person named Bane.</short-description>
	<history>An orphaned boy imprisoned by tyrants and used as a lab rat for high-risk experiments, Bane broke free from his shackles and grew to become one of the most powerful super-villains in Gotham City. His epic battle with Batman in the historic "Knightfall" storyline where he broke Batman's back and his subsequent appearances in comics, film and animation have made him one of the Dark Knight's most popular and enduring adversaries.Fueled by the uber-steroid serum known as Venom, Bane's strength is matched only by his intelligence. A master planner and strategist, he devoted his life to proving himself as the best. However, his quest for supremacy puts him directly at odds with the Dark Knight, whom Bane sees as the human embodiment of the law and order responsible for his captivity and torture as a child. Intriguingly, despite this hatred, Bane holds a much greater sense of respect for Gotham's guardian than most of his fellow villains, seeing Batman as his only real equal.But that equality comes at a price. The same serum that gives the villain his greatest strength is also his greatest weakness. Bane has developed an intense drug-like addiction to Venom and if deprived will go into severe withdrawal that could eventually culminate in madness. But if this will ultimately prove to be his downfall, it certainly hasn't yet.The crossover event of the year comes to its thrilling conclusion. The Turtles have one last, desperate shot at going home.Killer Frost has Catwoman on ice, trying to coerce her into coming over to the side of the Regime.Harley’s got an endangered friend to save, but there’s just one problem: she’s got to get through Arkham Asylum first!Tom Taylor (EARTH 2, Superior Iron Man) returns to the series he launched for this one time special event that kicks off the story you’ll see in the upcoming INJUSTICE: GODS AMONG USWhile Shredder enters an uneasy alliance with a deadly new partner, Casey Jones is arrested by the GCPD.As they reel from the effects of the Colossus virus, Batman and The Joker make their final stand in the ruins of Rome’s Coliseum.Superman and Flash find themselves up against the deadly Doomsday. They could use more help from their allies, but Cyborg and Yellow Lantern are off battling the Parasite.Double-shipping in December! After years of planning, the Arkham Knight is finally ready to make his move on Batman. But when he seeks out a surprising ally, Jonathan Crane—a.k.a.</history>

	<short-description>Slowing down the Fastest Man Alive is no easy task, let alone stopping him cold in his tracks. But it’s all in a day’s work for Captain Cold.Cold and calculating. That’s the best way to describe Leonard Snart, and it’s how he approached the job. Get in, get out and if anybody gets in the way, deal with them. No fuss and no muss. It was simple and it worked. At least until a certain scarlet-colored speedster interfered.</short-description>
	<history>Stealing a technologically advanced freeze gun and donning a signature blue and white parka, Leonard became Captain Cold, one of the Flash's most chillingly dangerous foes. Whether on his own or leading the gang of Central City villains known as the Rogues, Cold approaches the job at hand with an utter lack of emotion. His only care is getting it done as efficiently as possible. And yet, for a criminal, Cold is surprisingly ethical. He follows a strict Code of Honor: no drugs, no senseless violence, and above all, no killing women or children. He’s brought that code to the Rogues, convincing them that if anyone breaks it, they risk bringing the hammer down on themselves all that much harder, and with members in jail, the gang is less effective.Despite his cold-hearted nature and generally icy exterior, Snart does care about one thing more than anything else—his younger sister, who he has gone to extremes to defend and protect. His unparalleled mix of honor, loyalty, greed and ruthlessness make him one of the most unique villains in comics—but never mistake him for anything but. Get in the way of the job, and Captain Cold will chill you to the bone... Literally.“LIGHTNING STRIKES TWICE” Chapter One</history>

	<short-description>For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. And with every step the Flash takes toward the future, someone from the future is racing backward through time to stop him—the villainous speedster known as the Reverse-Flash.</short-description>
	<history>Born in the 25th Century, Eobard Thawne grew up idolizing the Flash and studying the legacy of the Scarlet Speedster. However, as he learned more about the Flash, Eobard discovered how his own life was linked to his hero’s: He was destined to become one of Barry Allen’s greatest villains, a revelation that led Eobard to grow unhinged. When he eventually replicated the chemical accident that granted the Flash super speed, Eobard took on a new identity—that of the Reverse-Flash, a wicked subversion of everything the Flash stands for.Granted with powers and abilities similar to that of the Flash, the Reverse-Flash is unwavering in his determination to oppose and destroy all that’s important to the Flash. His ability to travel through time allows him to attack the Flash at almost any point throughout history. However, he is unable to ever kill the Flash—for the Reverse-Flash would not exist if he killed his own inspiration. Instead, he does everything in his power to torment and torture the hero, an ominous visitor from a future the Flash never could’ve envisioned.Evil doppelgangers. Psychotic speedsters. Angry supervillains. Even the World's Fastest Man might have a hard time keeping up with all the action this season on The Flash.

	<short-description>What was the last thing you took home from an island getaway? A tacky souvenir? A great tan? More boring slideshows than you have friends to show?</short-description>
	<history>Spoiled billionaire Oliver Queen came home with an entirely different personality—and a newfound purpose in life. Completely self-absorbed and never caring about anything but himself, Queen was on a leisurely sailing trip when his assistant betrayed him, leaving him for dead on a desolate remote island. Stranded, he survived by, amongst other things, mastering a bow and arrow. When he eventually discovered the primitive locals that shared the island with him, he uncovered a large conglomerate sadistically exploiting and enslaving them. Ollie used his new skills of survival and archery to lead a rebellion— only to realize how similar his opponents were to the man he used to be.Returning to civilization only meant more opportunities to watch greed and corruption strangle Joe and Jane Average. Outfitting himself with arrows that shoot tear gas, smoke, nets, and more, Green Arrow has a trick shot for every obstacle. A modern-day Robin Hood, he constantly fights for the little guy as a crusading symbol for revolution. And his days on that island, filled with sweat, blood, and desperation, are a testament to what it takes for someone to answer that wake-up call, change their ways, and fly straight.As straight as an arrow. “The Death and Life of Oliver Queen” part four!“The Death and Life of Oliver Queen” part five! It’s Green Arrow and Black Canary versus Shado and the Ninth Circle in the belly of the Inferno.</history>

	<short-description>Born from a union between the Dark Knight and the daughter of one of his greatest enemies, Talia al Ghul, Damian Wayne is the ultimate poster boy of nature versus nurture—raised to become one of the world’s most dangerous and deadliest assassins and an unwilling chess piece in an ever-escalating battle between his parents.</short-description>
	<history>Created and raised for years without Batman’s knowledge, Damian was taught by his mother and the League of Assassins to become a lethal fighting machine—at 10-years-old, he already far surpasses the skill and ability of many of the DC Universe’s greatest fighters. Upon discovering Damian’s existence, Batman took his son under his wing as the new Robin in order to train him and break him from Talia’s programming, terrified of what the boy could become otherwise. Although many find Damian incredibly arrogant, his skills, abilities and intelligence do support his superior attitude. However, despite this, under his father’s tutelage, Damian is learning how to better relate to others while constantly struggling with the murderous tendencies instilled in him from a young age.Although his behavior at times suggests otherwise, Damian desperately wants to become a hero like his father and fights every second to stay on the path of heroism lest his mother’s nature turn him to villainy.The Teen Titans dispense some demons with the help of a fellow young hero in this new Justice League vs. Teen Titans clip.Justice League vs. Teen Titans, the latest entry in the popular, ongoing series of animated DC Universe Original Movies, is now available on Blu-Ray™ Deluxe Edition,...This free, stand-alone catalog features the first look at the upcoming DC UNIVERSE: REBIRTH.It’s Damian at the crossroads when he must make a final, fateful choice between his biological father—Batman—and his current father figure, Superman.The series conclusion to Damian Wayne’s quest for atonement!Justice League vs. Teen Titans welcomes the Teen Titans to the ever-expanding canon of classic DC Comics characters within the DC Universe Original Movies.Robin, Batman and Talia al Ghul team up on Dinosaur Island!

	<short-description>Seeing is believing. With so much information out there in the world, stories travel faster than ever and it’s hard to know what to believe. However, a good photo can put all uncertainty to rest, whether it offers confirmation of some sort of wrongdoing, a snapshot into the past, a peek behind a closed door, or proof that a man can fly. That’s what James “Jimmy” Bartholomew Olsen does—he captures pictures worth a thousand words as a photojournalist for The Daily Planet.</short-description>
	<history>An exceptionally bright and eager young adult, Jimmy joined the esteemed staff of the paper as a photojournalist and cub reporter. He faced the usual rookie challenges—chasing assignments all over Metropolis and beyond, following up on leads and juggling his co-workers' coffee orders. His dedication and enthusiasm paid off, as Jimmy managed to land on Editor-in-Chief Perry White's good side and often found himself teaming up with star reporter Lois Lane.He had friends in more powerful positions, too. Jimmy became buddies with Clark Kent and Superman, eventually learning that they were the same person. But in spite of his close relationship, Jimmy has never been envious of the Man of Steel’s abilities—though he has undergone transformations that have briefly given him powers—nor has Jimmy tried to take advantage of Superman's powers for personal gain. What he has done is allow himself to be inspired by Superman and become a positive influence on the people and community around him. Jimmy Olsen may not possess superpowers, but he represents the potential to be a hero that exists within us all.This free, stand-alone catalog features the first look at the upcoming DC UNIVERSE: REBIRTH.Superman is shocked to learn where Supergirl has been after disappearing for months as part three of “The Final Days of Superman” begins!“PATH TO DOOM” Chapter TwoIn part two of “The Final Days of Superman,” Superman enlists Batman to help him find Supergirl before he dies.</history>

	<short-description>OK, let’s just come out and say it: Wonder Woman is the most famous heroine of all time. No offense to the Lara Crofts, Buffys, or Disney princesses of the world, but none of them have been plastered on as many magazine covers, adorned as many T-shirts, or sold the countless comics, dolls, and action figures that Wonder Woman has. The full package of beauty, brains, and brawn, she’s been a feminist icon since her star-spangled intro in 1941.</short-description>
	<history>Wonder Woman is Princess Diana of the immortal Amazons from Greek mythology.  When army pilot Steve Trevor crashes on the warriors’ secluded island paradise, Diana wins the right to escort him home and make her people known to the world. Entering our cynical world for the first time, there’s a lot she must wrap her head around, especially our ways of war, hate, and, well… dating. Helping her are her superhuman strength and speed, as well as the trademark bulletproof bracelets, but it’s probably her Golden Lasso of Truth most people really wish they had.Torn between a mission to promote peace and her own warrior upbringing, Wonder Woman fights evil while hoping to unlock the potential of a humanity she doesn’t always understand.“The Extinction Machine” part three!“Wonder Woman Year One” part two!The Titan has awoken, forcing Wonder Woman to confront her most powerful foe.

	<short-description>If movie stars and athletes serve as the icons of our modern, sponsor-driven age, then surely super heroes would be the ultimate celebrities. Strap on a power suit, take to the sky (making sure to fly over any cities of influence) and do your part to save the world…after the cameras have arrived. It’s a surefire formula for instant fame.</short-description>
	<history>At least, it seemed that way to Michael Jon Carter. Born far in the future, Michael was a star quarterback before he was caught betting on his own games. His reputation ruined, he stole a power suit and journeyed to the past, where he branded himself Booster Gold and used his powers and his knowledge of our future to mold himself into a super hero. Michael sought the fame he once had as a star athlete, and his new identity brought sponsorships, endorsement deals and a verified Twitter account. But it also brought something else—responsibility.As a time-traveler, Booster Gold understands how delicate our timeline is, and he often finds himself protecting the timestream. But in the ultimate irony for a fame-seeker, no one can ever know it’s him. After all, if people find out what he’s doing, it could change history and threaten the timestream. It’s a responsibility that Booster Gold has come to take seriously, suggesting that there may be more driving this spotlight-loving hero than a simple quest for adoration. Even if he does spend as much time signing autographs as he does saving lives.Evil Zeus of Injustice League 3000 has returned, and he’s created a new race of the most bizarre New Gods in DCU history! And a new threat enters U.P.Like Los Angeles didn’t have enough problems with DC Comics moving in, now Harley Quinn is determined to take over Tinseltown!There’s a new bad guy in town: Gridlock, the villain who’s stuck in the past! And now, he’s out to stop the future from coming!It’s the Super-Buddies versus Giant Turtle Olsen starring in...Who the hell cares what it’s called? It’s Giant Turtle Olsen!

With his wings and his trusty mace, Hawkman patrols the skies with a savage intensity.

Many people fear Hawkman’s savage brutality and his penchant for violence, but that appears to be just the attitude he wants them to have.His barbaric methods and disregard for rules and regulations often put him at odds with law enforcement and his fellow heroes, but through it all, Hawkman's personal code and sense of justice prevail above all else—it just so happens that personal code and sense of justice also involves smashing many thingsBatman forms an alliance with the savage Hawkman, who is still determined to remove Hawkgirl from Superman’s regime.Is Midway City haunted?

	<short-description>Many teens undergo an anti-establishment phase. They fight against authority, rejecting the government and any type of oversight. They demand equality and oppose corruption. Sometimes though, it's more than just standing against the establishment. Sometimes, in order to combat corruption, it’s better to abolish the establishment completely and let anarchy reign.</short-description>
	<history>Highly intelligent and deeply philosophical, Lonnie Machin developed a strong ethical and apolitical code. Looking at the world around him, he saw corruption, social oppression and the suffering of everyday people—and saw the government doing nothing about it. Taking a cue from the Dark Knight, Machin studied martial arts and put his engineering abilities and knowledge of computer technology to use to become a vigilante himself: Anarky. Although he thinks of himself as a hero like Batman and believes anarchy would help the people help themselves, Batman views Anarky's methods and actions as childish and violent, and considers Anarky a public threat, plain and simple.Anarky uses his abilities to bring down any corporation or authoritative entity that he feels hurts and oppresses people. While he can throw a punch as well as anyone, he relies primarily on his thorough understanding of modern technology to defeat his foes along with the very essence of anarchy itself—surprise."Felicity's out of surgery.

	<short-description>Make all the sushi jokes, YouTube spoofs, and SNL sketches you want, Aquaman’s been an icon for over seventy years. The King of the Seven Seas. Reluctant ruler of Atlantis. A man who holds his own against heroes like Superman and Wonder Woman. He’s so recognizable that when officials speak about the perils of sea pollution, they’ll whip out Aquaman references to sound hip.</short-description>
	<history>Cast out from Atlantis as a baby, Arthur Curry grew up on land, thinking himself a normal human. But when he matured, Atlantis returned, claiming him as their rightful king. Caught between a surface world constantly ravaging the sea and Atlanteans looking to lash out in revolt, he’s committed to protecting the entire globe.Aquaman is the king of all things aqua. He can breathe underwater, swim at tremendous speeds, and telepathically communicate with sea life. Being able to withstand ocean depths, he gets bonus points on land with his superhuman strength, enhanced senses, and nearly impenetrable skin. And although his courage and decisive nature have proven him a true heir to Atlantis’s throne, the continual conflict between land and sea makes him a citizen of both—and at home in neither. “The Drowning” part four.

	<history>Young Barry Allen’s life stopped the minute his mother was murdered. The true killer never found, its mystery obsessed Barry, driving him to become a forensic scientist. Consumed by his work, he spent his life chained to his desk, solving every case that flew across it. But when a freak lightning bolt hits a nearby shelf in his lab, Barry receives super-speed, becoming the Flash. Now, he’ll race up buildings, across oceans, and around the world to get his man—while getting introduced to a world so much bigger than his old life of microscopes and cold cases.Able to run at near light-speeds, his powers provide the ultimate caffeine kick: He can run up buildings, move so swiftly he phases through objects, create sonic booms with the snap of his fingers—and never need to order delivery. Despite his speed, Barry can become so obsessed with crime-solving he can still lose track of everything else around him, leaving the fastest man alive constantly running a minute behind.“Lightning Strikes Twice” part five! With Central City now protected by dozens of freshly trained Flashes, Barry Allen takes time out to explore a new relationship.“The Extinction Machine” part three!“Lightning Strikes Twice” part four!“The Extinction Machine” part two!</history>

	<short-description>Don't make us laugh. The green hair. The crazed smile. The maniacal cackle. You know exactly who he is and how far he'd go to put a smile on your face.</short-description>
	<history>Whether by way of award-winning films like "The Dark Knight," Emmy-winning animated programs like "Batman: The Animated Series," video game appearances such as the record-breaking "Batman: Arkham Asylum," or the countless comics stacking comic book shelves and digital libraries, the Joker stands unquestionably as the most recognizable and popular comic book villain in pop culture history. Unpredictable, violent and incredibly dangerous, he is chaos personified and has taken on everyone from his archenemy Batman to even the Man of Steel.But Gotham remains his primary home and Batman his biggest adversary, and no hero is perhaps better suited as in many ways, the Joker is the polar opposite of the Dark Knight. Both were created by a great tragedy, but Batman has since vowed to do whatever it takes to prevent similar incidents, the Joker revels in creating chaos and destroying lives, believing that life’s a big joke and psychotically demonstrating that in a moment, it can all change.Not much is known about his past, but his acts during the present are what define the Joker as one of the greatest threats to our heroes and the people they've sworn to protect. He's killed a Robin, crippled Batgirl, and tortured and murdered countless people throughout the DC Universe—all just for a laugh.Return to two of the greatest superhero games of all time - visually enhanced and recreated for a new generation in Batman: Return to Arkham.Includes Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City and all previously released DLC.Pre-order today:...Worst.

	<short-description>A member of the infamous Trinity of Sin, the Phantom Stranger agelessly walks the world, vastly knowledgeable and a mystery to everyone he encounters.Condemned for the crime of betrayal, the Circle of Eternity sentenced the Phantom Stranger and his fellow sinners—the Question and Pandora—to eternal punishments specific to their crimes and vices. For the Stranger, he would forever remain a mystery to those he meets—cursed to see the world, know its destiny but never truly be a part of it.</short-description>
	<history>Throughout history the Stranger has appeared before many heroes, present for some of the most pivotal moments in time. Knowing more than he should and cursed to witness these catastrophes but never intervene himself, he has even gone so far as to influence others’ actions, but to what end, none truly know.Although many speculate his true origins and purpose, none know for sure—he remains an ally to some, an enemy to others and a stranger to all.The team’s attempt to defend the Earth from invasion by the Elder Gods takes them to a creepy New England town, inhabited by one very nasty creature.There’s nothing unusual about ghosts disappearing—but if other ghosts don’t know what happened to them, there’s a mystery afoot!A new epic begins, and a major turning point in the life of Black Alice gets underway!“House of Strangers” concludes the war between the forces of magic and the Elder Gods—with the Six caught in the middle!Sixpack travels to the ends of the earth in his search for answers, but Dogwelder has already come face-to-face with his own past.Sixpack learns the awful truth about his somewhat unlikely return to Gotham City, as a mysterious guide takes him beyond the bounds of life itself and into the mystical realms.This is it! The entire DC Universe, from the dawn of time through The New 52, must fight to survive against a threat that bends the Multiverse to its will.</history>

	<short-description>Someone has to do the dirty work. Well, in the DC Universe, that someone is Amanda Waller. She's intimidating, formidable and downright ruthless. She uses those traits to her advantage, and anyone who goes up against her quickly learns how she earned her nickname, “The Wall.”</short-description>
	<history>Waller pulled herself up from rough beginnings to serve her country as a covert agent before becoming Director of the Advanced Research Group for Uniting Superhumans (A.R.G.U.S.). In this role, she created a highly classified team of super-villains known as Task Force X. The members of this specialized covert team are forced to go on whatever assignments Waller deems will serve the greater good. Refuse and members learn that the risky missions aren’t the only reason the team’s commonly referred to as the Suicide Squad.As the Squad’s leader, Waller often acts coldly and doesn't hesitate to put the team in near-impossible situations. She doesn't follow any standardized moral guidebook but instead operates by her own rules. The missions she assigns to the team serve a higher purpose…in theory. Being compassionate isn't an asset in Waller's line of work, but acting without emotion means she's not always so different from the villains in the Squad. In leading them, Waller has to be careful not to become one of them. If it’s not already too late.Soldier. War hero. Traitor. Captain Rick Flag was one of America’s greatest military commanders before he was banished to a secret military prison.From the pages of SUICIDE SQUAD comes an all-new series featuring two of the team’s most infamous heroes, El Diablo and Boomerang!Worst.

	<short-description>After a strange and bizarre laboratory accident, Jay Garrick awoke to discover he had gained amazing abilities—he could move at superhuman speeds, far beyond those of any normal man or woman. Donning a costume and stylized metal helmet based on the one worn by the Roman god Mercury, Jay used his powers to fight crime and protect the citizens of Keystone City. He became the Fastest Man Alive, the Hero of Earth-2, the Flash!</short-description>
	<history>A founding member of the Justice Society of America—whose ranks include Green Lantern (Alan Scott), Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Wildcat, Power Girl and more—Jay was one of the first super heroes of Earth-2, a parallel world to the main DC Universe and home to the heroes of the Golden Age. As the Flash, Jay battled many super-criminals and saved the world alongside his friends numerous times. But he forever changed not only his world, but all worlds when he met his Earth-1 counterpart, Barry Allen. This famous meeting of the Flash of Two Worlds bridged the gap between realities and led to many team-ups, alignments and friendships between the heroes of both Earths. Together, the Flashes would join forces to battle Zoom, the Reverse-Flash, and many other super-villains.By tapping into the extra-dimensional Speed Force, Jay can move at speeds approaching the speed of light. This power also allows him to have faster than normal reflexes and grants him the ability to vibrate fast enough to obscure his features, preventing the need for him to wear a mask. His experience, compassion and kindness have led him to become a mentor to not only future generations of speedsters, but to countless other heroes throughout the DC Universe.While Batman and his allies fight to keep their city safe from organized crime, Green Lantern and his wonders struggle to prevent the world from toppling into all-out war.Green Lantern learns that even a god can sometimes be powerless in the face of ordinary men.The Mist rises in New Gotham as Batman takes on this strange new foe! And Hawkgirl finds herself outnumbered as she confronts Fury and the new Amazons.</history>

	<short-description>Some villains want to increase their financial standings. Some want to best their enemy in battle. Others want to take over a country and a few even desire to rule the planet. One stands above them all. One whose ambition extends beyond simply conquering the world. One that doesn't want to rule humanity—but all of existence. He is Darkseid, and when it comes to villains in the DC Universe, it doesn't get any bigger or badder than him.</short-description>
	<history>The ruling dictator of the world of Apokolips, Darkseid operates on a scale that terrifyingly dwarfs those of the world's greatest heroes. He commands a legion of powerful creatures known as Parademons and his court consists of some of the most depraved, sadistic and frighteningly powerful beings in the universe. Darkseid's near limitless might is matched by his immeasurable intelligence, and while he generally prefers to manipulate and control others to reach his goals, he is able to single-handedly stand toe-to-toe against the entirety of the Justice League.Darkseid seeks to enslave all life in the universe, reshape existence in his image and exert ultimate control. His desire is to eliminate free will and control everyone so that they bow beneath his feet and do whatever he says, and he certainly has the means to do it. His extraordinary physical strength, intelligence, godlike powers and army of Parademons make him not only a threat to our world and its heroes, but to every world within reach. He’s no less than the single most dangerous villain in the universe.Superman and the New Gods launch their plan to free the young boy and his dog from his Apokolips prison, but Darkseid’s ultimate prize is within sight, and the only person standing iThis is it!!

	<short-description>Some of the most beautiful plants in the world are dangerous. They’re alluring, beckoning you closer with their shape and their bloom, and by the time you realize the peril you’re in, it’s too late. In nature, beauty can be a weapon. So it’s fitting that Poison Ivy, Gotham’s beautiful-but-deadly eco-terrorist, would use it as hers.</short-description>
	<history>Once an innovative, radical botanical biochemist named Pamela Isley, Poison Ivy’s academic ambitions died on the vine when she was subjected to less-than-reputable experiments. These tests twisted Isley’s mind and gave her a dangerous set of superpowers. Ivy found herself able to control plants and began to use her wiles and pheromones to mesmerize and manipulate people. She entrances them into doing her bidding and then draws them in, where they soon discover Ivy’s other power: her kiss and touch can be lethal.Some terrorists fight for their corner of the world, but Poison Ivy fights for the world itself. She’s a self-appointed defender of the environment. To her, plants have as much right to live as people…maybe more. Ivy sees humanity as a threatening blight the planet would be better without. Her utter conviction, combined with her noxious abilities, make her a beautiful but daunting adversary that should never by underestimated.Return to two of the greatest superhero games of all time - visually enhanced and recreated for a new generation in Batman: Return to Arkham.Includes Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City and all previously released DLC.Pre-order today:...Mera adjusts to a life without her powers—and starts to fall in love with Arthur.Batwoman, Catwoman, Zatanna, Harley and Ivy begin to link up to work together as a rebellion, sending coordinated attacks across Germany and leading massive uprisings of refugees and</history>

When Grundy dies, he eventually rises again, emerging from the depths of his original resting place in the swamp to wreak havoc on the living.</short-description>

Other times, he’s reborn with a high level of intelligence, granting him a deadly combination of brains and brawn. But no matter the changes in his personality, he always has the same superhuman strength, stamina and near indestructibility, and his desires remain evil and corrupt.

His mere presence alone is enough to cause riots and acts of violence—which is exactly what he wants.A villain by his very nature, Ares is a perpetual war machine—a constant, unswayable force that will always seek to incite discord and devastation.

	<short-description>With a name like Zatanna Zatara, becoming a professional stage magician almost seems like an unquestionable career choice. Of course, it doesn’t hurt that the illusions she creates and the spells she weaves to dazzle the audience just so happen to be real.</short-description>
	<history>Intelligent, confident, self-assured and able to manipulate reality itself with her vast magical abilities, Zatanna balances her time as a skilled stage illusionist with battling the dark arts alongside some of the world’s greatest super heroes. By reciting spells backwards, she can invoke anything her imagination wills, and her inventiveness often allows her to find creative solutions to even the trickiest of problems.However, Zatanna is no stranger to the dangers of magic, having lost her father to the dark arts. Although this left her without a mentor and relatively inexperienced in the world of magic, it only furthered her resolve to stand against anyone seeking to use magic at the cost of others. But if Zatanna hopes to escape her father's fate, she'll have to quickly master her craft before facing down the world's most powerful mystics.Batwoman, Catwoman, Zatanna, Harley and Ivy begin to link up to work together as a rebellion, sending coordinated attacks across Germany and leading massive uprisings of refugees andThe most ghost-filled mansion on Coney Island has been demolished—and unfortunately, every one of its spirits has decided that Harley’s hacienda is the hot new hangout to haunt!An old friend appears in the swamp with an unbelievable proposition for Swamp Thing: using a dark spell, it might be possible for the Avatar of the Green to return to his human form Mera adjusts to a life without her powers—and starts to fall in love with Arthur.Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy make it to Berlin to find the Joker’s cabaret in the hands of the Joker’s Daughter, who has banished a magic-less Zatanna and Constantine onto the streetsWhile Lex Luthor continues to manipulate events behind the scenes, Kate Kane remains in the clutches of the Nazi Edel Nacht, who lays out his plans for world conquest.</history>

	<short-description>Dark Knight. Caped Crusader. World’s Greatest Detective. Whatever you know him as, wherever you know him from—the blockbuster movies, TV shows, video games, cartoons, or millions of comics—Batman is proof you don’t need superpowers to be a superhero… and the poster boy for what a bad childhood can do to you.Millionaire Bruce Wayne was just a kid when he watched his parents get gunned down during a mugging in Gotham City. The crime would define his life, as he dedicated himself to becoming the world’s greatest weapon against crime—the Batman.</short-description>
	<history>Forget his Batarangs, Batmobile, or Utility Belt filled with high-tech weapons. Batman is the most feared superhero of all, because he’s pushed himself to the absolute pinnacle of human achievement. He’s a brilliant detective who’s mastered fighting techniques the world’s barely heard of. An Olympic-caliber athlete with a plan for every occasion, Batman’s seemingly always five steps ahead of his foes. But in his crusade against injustice, two questions always loom: How far will he go to protect the innocent, and will he sacrifice his humanity along the way?“The Extinction Machine” part two!“Made in China” part two! The New Super-Man must face off against the Justice League of China?Return to two of the greatest superhero games of all time - visually enhanced and recreated for a new generation in Batman: Return to Arkham.Includes Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City and all previously released DLC.Pre-order today:...“The Extinction Machine” part three!With the downfall of Brother Eye, a power vacuum has opened up in Gotham City and a longtime villain has stepped into the void to take control.</history>

	<short-description>When all the chips are down and everything’s on the line, what would you do to ensure you come out on top? What would you be willing to sacrifice? For occult detective John Constantine, the only thing more difficult than answering that question almost every single day, is living with his decision.</short-description>
	<history>From a young age, Constantine sought refuge in the occult as an escape from his hard life. It didn’t take long for him to discover he had a gift for it, but he also learned the deadly price of the dark arts when his inexperience cost the life of another. Since then, Constantine has vowed mastery over the occult and the demonic creatures that seek to abuse its power. But in so doing, he’s also learned the hard truth about what it takes to stand against powerful dark forces—a willingness to sacrifice anything and anyone.While Constantine prefers to bluff his way out of trouble by relying on subterfuge and slight of hand, he also never hesitates to lie, double-cross or hurt and betray those closest to him. But this apparent callousness masks an interesting truth about Constantine: If the fight against evil forces requires a willingness to sacrifice everything and everyone that you hold dear, then a hard attitude is likely necessary. Whether it’s due to a sense of self-loathing, a resistance to any sort of authority or a deeply hidden desire to do what’s right, Constantine is willing to make the hard choices…so that no one else has to.“The Poison Truth” part one!

	<short-description>In the DC Universe, organizations come together for many reasons—to protect the planet from super-villain threats, to monitor the super-powered individuals of the world, and to keep humanity’s darker nature in check. In the case of the Hierarchy of International Vengeance and Extermination, or H.I.V.E., as it’s more commonly known, the goal is simple: to bring together scientists and trained forces for the sole purpose of eliminating every super hero from the face of the planet.</short-description>
	<history>Although there have been several incarnations of H.I.V.E. throughout the years, each founded by various members of the super-villain community—including Damien Darhk, Queen Bee and Adeline Kane—its main mission statement has remained the same. Sometimes the organization pushes its own agenda; other times, it offers its services to anyone willing to pay the right price.H.I.V.E. consists of many skilled members, from scientists to trained assassins. Although willing to go after any super heroes, H.I.V.E. often finds itself at odds with the Teen Titans, and as such, has regularly worked alongside the team's greatest adversary, Slade Wilson, aka Deathstroke.Is Felicity going to survive?

	<short-description>It’s a hard life being a hero. It’s stressful, dangerous and often thankless. Heroes save lives, but also get the blame when lives are lost. They have to make a thousand decisions, big and small, and sometimes they choose the wrong path. Without a rock solid mentor, the walls can close in. That happened to Arsenal.</short-description>
	<history>Born as Roy Harper, Arsenal was orphaned and taken in by Green Arrow. Oliver Queen took Roy's strong archery skills and trained him until Roy became an expert marksman. However, knowing how to hold your own in combat doesn't prepare you for all of life's challenges. A run of unfortunate events, including the Teen Titans disbanding, a break-up, and some struggles with Green Arrow, opened the door to a treacherous path for Roy. He leaned on drugs to get through the hard times.While Roy’s since gotten clean, like everyone who’s struggled with substance abuse, addiction remains a constant conflict for him. But Arsenal’s thrived as a hero in spite of it. He's exhibited courage and skill at Green Arrow's side, as a member of the Teen Titans and most recently, fighting alongside another hero with a dark past, Red Hood. Though he's perhaps suffered more than most, Arsenal continues to battle bravely, both against foes and his inner demons.After an old ally returns to the team, the Titans set their sights on a dangerous enemy with the power to change reality itself!Friends. Teammates. Titans.Arsenal confronts his greatest mistake: the mercenaries known as the Iron Rule!The Joker’s Daughter’s master plan is revealed!

	<short-description>Elusive, enigmatic, and extremely well-connected and established in the criminal underworld, Damien Darhk's exact origins and abilities remain a mystery. However, the threat he poses to the world does not.</short-description>
	<history>Primarily an enemy of the Teen Titans, the criminal mastermind Darhk served as a founding member of H.I.V.E., a massive evil scientific and mercenary organization seeking to eliminate from the world all super heroes. With a genius-level intellect, Darhk instinctively and intuitively knows and understands the latest forms of mass communication and has access to unique high-tech equipment and weaponry unknown to any other organization.Regardless of his activities, Darhk has remained untouchable by the CIA, FBI and NSA. Even more baffling, despite his vast network and apparent decades of connections, Darhk physically looks much younger than someone of his power should appear. But don’t let his youthfully innocent face fool you—Darhk’s as dark as they come.</history>

	<short-description>Sometimes it takes a great tragedy to truly push a hero beyond their limits—to break them down and make them an even greater super hero. Those that haven't experienced this sort of loss will never become greater than they are. Many heroes had these tragedies happen at a young age or in the early days of their careers. But for those who haven't, one man makes it his duty to break them down in order to make them better, even if he has to force their tragedy himself: Zoom.</short-description>
	<history>Hunter Zolomon's life was riddled by brutal tragedies. As a child, he discovered his father was a serial killer who also murdered Hunter's mother after she tried to stop him. This tragedy inspired Hunter to study psychology and criminology, and to join the FBI; but a miscalculation during a case led to the death of his father-in-law. Then, things took a turn for the truly dark after an attack by Gorilla Grodd left Hunter paralyzed. He begged his friend the Flash to go back in time and prevent the attack from happening—and the Flash refused.Taking matters into his own hands, Hunter attempted to go back in time himself, leading to an accidental explosion, another tragedy—but one that made him more than what he was. Gaining the ability of perceived super-speed and adopting the name Zoom, Hunter dedicated his life to making sure people experienced their own personal tragedy in order to make them better heroes—starting with the Flash.Zoom is utterly unlike the Flash and other speedsters, both setting him apart and making him one of the most dangerous and challenging of Flash’s foes. His speed doesn’t come from the Speed Force, but from altering his own relative time, slowing or speeding up the world around him, allowing him to run even faster than the Flash. His warped sense of heroism and villainy has led Zoom to continuously threaten not only those closest to the Flash but also countless heroes throughout the DC Universe. But really, he's just trying to make them better…by any means necessary.</history>

	<short-description>Oswald Cobblepot. Not exactly a name designed to shake the pillars of Gotham’s dark criminal underworld. Maybe it’s his other name that strikes fear into the hearts of citizens both good and bad: The Penguin.</short-description>
	<history>This is a villain fueled by a pathological rage that compels him to turn his odd physique, bird-like profile and awkward waddle into a well-dressed force for fear. No one knows more about what the evil forces of Gotham are up to at any given moment than he and he uses that information to blackmail, intimidate and corrupt anyone he can, especially when it’s in the service of bringing down Batman.They say you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, but they also say evil is as evil does. A master manipulator, the Penguin is usually surrounded by violent henchmen who do his bidding without question. But when it comes down to a face-to-face, expect him to unleash a deadly barrage from a variety of umbrella weapons and other ingenious devices—often taking the form of fowl. And when all else fails, the Penguin will fight as dirty as they come, hand to hand combat doesn’t ruffle his feathers at all.Return to two of the greatest superhero games of all time - visually enhanced and recreated for a new generation in Batman: Return to Arkham.Includes Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City and all previously released DLC.Pre-order today:...The crossover event of the year comes to its thrilling conclusion. The Turtles have one last, desperate shot at going home.</history>

	<short-description>What’s most important for a hero? Incredible strength? There’s always something or someone stronger. Super-speed? Hope you don’t trip. Telepathy? Do you REALLY want to know what others are thinking about you? You don’t need any of those abilities to be a member of the Green Lantern Corps, but a strong will backed by a wonderful imagination are essential requirements.</short-description>
	<history>Patrolling the farthest reaches of the galaxy, the Green Lantern Corps operates as an intergalactic police force, helping to keep peace throughout the universe. With members made up of aliens from across the universe and a base of operations on the planet Oa, the Green Lanterns follow the command of the Guardians—a race of immortal beings who have been around since the beginning of time. Utilizing a special ring of immense power, Lanterns can create energy constructs in the shape of whatever their imagination can conjure. The power ring can also translate any language, grant its wielder flight and offer protection in almost any environment. It is, quite simply, the strongest weapon in the universe.It should be known, however, that one does not simply enlist in the Corps. Only a chosen few get to harness the power of the ring. With the likes of Hal Jordan, John Stewart, Kyle Rayner, Guy Gardner, Simon Baz, Kilowog and Mogo among their current and past ranks, the Corps holds itself to only the highest standard of character and hero—individuals capable of overcoming great fear and possessing the will to do whatever it takes to keep those around them safe. So, when you look up at the stars, take comfort in knowing that the Green Lantern Corps is watching over you…in brightest day and blackest night.“Red Planet” part five!“Sinestro’s Law” part three!Superstar artist Ethan Van Sciver returns to the world of Green Lantern!“Red Planet” part four!

	<short-description>Super heroes aren't the answer to every problem. Sometimes, extreme situations require extreme measures…or extreme individuals. The sort of individuals who call the infamous Belle Reve Prison home—super-villains.</short-description>
	<history>Of course, no one will officially admit to any of this. That's the charm of Task Force X, perhaps better known by its nickname: the Suicide Squad. This team of super-villains, assembled by their director Amanda “The Wall” Waller, undertakes high-risk covert operations and in exchange receive commuted prison sentences. And we do mean high-risk. Regardless of abilities and talent, every member of the Squad is expendable—it’s expected that many will not return. As expendable assets, all members are fitted with an explosive device in their neck to assure obedience. If Squad members try to escape while on a mission...well, escape isn't an option. Run away and it’s BOOM!Given the rigorous requirements of the job, the Suicide Squad lineup is always in flux. The roster has included Deadshot, a precise marksman and assassin; Harley Quinn, a peppy but psychotic villain; Captain Boomerang, the man who turns boomerangs into lethal weapons; Enchantress, a powerful sorceress who can wield magical energy; and their sometimes field leader Rick Flag, an elite soldier who is one of the only members who isn’t a super-villain.A group of super-villains who have license to take drastic action in the name of serving a mission? There's no way that can end badly.Soldier. War hero. Traitor. Captain Rick Flag was one of America’s greatest military commanders before he was banished to a secret military prison.From the pages of SUICIDE SQUAD comes an all-new series featuring two of the team’s most infamous heroes, El Diablo and Boomerang!“The Black Vault” part one!When a retired American politician is taken to Europe and tried for alleged war crimes, the USA must recover him from an allied nation before terrible truths are revealed.Delve, if you dare, into the twisted mind of Harley Quinn as she wrestles with her past and questions her future in the mind-bending finale of NEW SUICIDE SQUAD.Worst. Heroes. Ever. See SUICIDE SQUAD in theaters August 5th.http://www.suicidesquad.comhttp://facebook.com/SuicideSquadhttp://instagram....</history>

	<history>Betrayed by her own sister and forced into slavery, Princess Koriand’r of Tamaran experience torture, exploitation and experimentation at the hands of others—but instead of it breaking her, it only made her stronger.

And it was then that Koriand’r made a decision that changed her place in life forever. She decided to become the super hero known as Starfire.Like all Tamaraneans, Starfire’s alien physiology allows her to absorb ultraviolet radiation and convert it to energy in order to fly. However, due to the experiments conducted on her during her imprisonment, she can also channel and project that same energy as destructive blasts.Despite the hardships she experienced early in her life, Starfire remains a courageous and dedicated hero, who despises seeing anyone else experience the pain she went through herself. She is incredibly loyal and optimistic and lives to see and experience everything the universe has to offer.When Starfire comes down with a case of the dreaded Tamaranian flu, the Teen Titans go to another dimension to find the rare medicine she needs.The Teen Titans dispense some demons with the help of a fellow young hero in this new Justice League vs. Teen Titans clip.Justice League vs. Teen Titans, the latest entry in the popular, ongoing series of animated DC Universe Original Movies, is now available on Blu-Ray™ Deluxe Edition,...This free, stand-alone catalog features the first look at the upcoming DC UNIVERSE: REBIRTH.The Teen Titans will square off against the Justice League in our next animated movie, but first they’ll both have to face DC All Access!

	<short-description>Power corrupts. It's a trial many heroes have had to face. But no one exemplifies this more than Black Adam—a champion turned villain whose quest for dominance over all magic drives him to destroy anything that stands in his path.Long ago, the council of wizards—powerful beings that held dominion over all magic in the world—chose the warrior Black Adam as their champion, granting him vast magical powers and abilities. However, that power only further skewed Adam's already maligned moral compass, and rather than use his newfound gifts to help others, he used it to dominate them.</short-description>
	<history>Adam turned against the wizards and after a brutal battle was imprisoned for thousands of years. But now he is free once more, and his insatiable quest to conquer the world, to control all magic, continues. The only thing that stands in his way is Shazam!, the new champion of magic—and Black Adam will do anything in his power to destroy him and assert his position as the true ruler of the world.Driven by a need to rule, incredibly arrogant and one of the most powerful beings on the planet, Black Adam lives by a simple creed: kneel at his feet or be crushed by his boot.With Superman back at full power, he takes the fight right to Vandal Savage in the epic conclusion to "Savage Dawn"!Batman and the Justice League try to stop The Joker and the Injustice gang from stealing new weapons technology from S.T.A.R.

	<short-description>Independently wealthy. Utilizes his vast fortune to finance and further his goals. Incredibly intelligent. A brilliant strategist. Master martial artist. Allied with a host of expert warriors under his command. No, we’re not talking about Batman, but a man who has proven to be one of his most dangerous and destructive adversaries. He is Ra’s al Ghul, the Demon’s Head, leader of the League of Assassins and the only person in the world capable of going toe-to-toe with the Bat on every level.</short-description>
	<history>Ra’s al Ghul first became aware of Batman after the Dark Knight became entangled with his daughter, Talia. As another man of power who was fully committed to his cause, Ra’s al Ghul saw Batman as a worthy heir to his position as leader of the League of Assassins, a shadowy group that seeks to cleanse the world of corruption and achieve perfect environmental balance. However, the Dark Knight refused, seeing Ra’s al Ghul’s methods—such as killing half of humanity through biological warfare—too ruthless and brutal.Utilizing the regenerative powers of the Lazarus Pit, Ra’s al Ghul can heal himself from any injury and has often been resurrected from death itself. His exact age is unknown, but he has been around for hundreds of years, giving him an immeasurable amount of knowledge and resources. He is easily one of the world’s greatest threats and can be seen as the embodiment of Batman’s desire to be more than a man, to be a symbol. For long after Bruce Wayne is gone, Ra’s al Ghul shall live on.Return to two of the greatest superhero games of all time - visually enhanced and recreated for a new generation in Batman: Return to Arkham.Includes Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City and all previously released DLC.Pre-order today:...After a bitter betrayal by a trusted comrade, Slade Wilson finds reluctant allies in his estranged children, Rose and Jericho.It’s all-out war!With the life of his daughter Rose hanging in the balance, Slade Wilson is forced into a tense alliance with Ra’s al Ghul and the League of Assassins.The crossover event of the year comes to its thrilling conclusion.

	<short-description>"In blackest day, in brightest night, beware your fears made into light. Let those who try to stop what's right, burn like my power, Sinestro's might!"From the greatest Green Lantern to the Corps' greatest enemy, Thaal Sinestro's fall from grace can easily be attributed to his own hubris—but if you ask him, the real problem lies in the Green Lantern Corps itself and its creators, the Guardians of the Universe. After all, as far as Sinestro is concerned, everything he does is for the good of the universe.</short-description>
	<history>Originally hailing from the planet Korugar, Sinestro once served as the Green Lantern of Sector 1417 and quickly gained recognition among the Corps for his ability to police his sector. However, peace came at a price. Sinestro's determination to preserve order caused him to act more as a dictator than a protector, conquering his own home planet in the process. Control became his means to an end, the true path to order in both his sector and the universe as a whole, and Sinestro did anything necessary to achieve it. It wasn't until then new recruit Hal Jordan learned of Sinestro's methods that the Guardians were informed and Sinestro was ejected from the Corps.Steadfast in his belief of moral superiority and methods of maintaining order, Sinestro formed the Sinestro Corps, harnessing the yellow energy of fear, to not only combat the Guardians, whom he sees as the main obstacle on the path to intergalactic peace, but to also strengthen the Green Lantern Corps. For it is Sinestro’s opinion that the Green Lanterns have long since been held back by their creators.Highly intelligent with an almost unbreakable will, Thaal Sinestro will do anything to achieve control and thereby order—control over his emotions, control over others, and even control over the entire universe.“Sinestro’s Law” part three!“SINESTRO’S LAW” Chapter OneWelcome to the DC Comics Art Academy, a series of art tutorials recorded at Comic-Cons throughout 2015 and featuring many of the gifted and unique artists working for DC today.

	<short-description>All of us have a little voice in our heads that helps us make wise decisions—at least when we’re willing to listen to it. But if your voice belongs to an antisocial, student bookworm complaining about getting to chemistry class on time, you’re probably the combustible hero known as Firestorm.</short-description>
	<history>When it comes to personalities, Ronnie Raymond and Jason Rusch are on opposite ends of the figurative periodic table. Ronnie’s a good-looking athlete with a quick-to-action attitude and a healthy dose of ego, while Jason’s a gifted science student who’s never happier than when he’s working alone in a lab. Caught in an explosion that should have killed them both, the pair were instead fused together into one nuclear-powered being. Bonded through a phenomenon known as the Firestorm Matrix, Ronnie and Jason act together as a single super hero, with Ronnie usually in control of Firestorm’s body, while the more cerebral Jason lends support as a secondary consciousness within the Matrix.Ronnie and Jason have learned to separate at will, returning to their normal forms and capabilities. But when they’re bonded and utilizing the power of the Matrix, Firestorm can fly, absorb radiation, and fire highly destructive blasts of energy from his hands. He possesses immense strength and can rearrange inorganic objects into other shapes or objects—provided he knows their atomic makeup. This last requirement is one of the many reasons that Jason’s contributions are so important, but that doesn’t mean it’s always smooth sailing. In fact, with such different personalities, the two frequently clash both inside and out of the Firestorm Matrix. As a result, Firestorm remains one of the more unpredictable and volatile heroes out there, as well as one of the most dangerous, since too much internal friction could cause a nuclear explosion. But when they do work together, Jason and Ronnie can accomplish great things. Firestorm can quite literally change the world for the better, provided the two young men powering him can only agree on how.METAMORPHOWritten by AARON LOPRESTIArt by AARON LOPRESTI and LIVESAYMETAMORPHO • Written by AARON LOPRESTIArt by AARON LOPRESTI and JONATHAN GLAPION</history>

	<short-description>Big things come in small packages. Just an age-old cliché, right? Actually, it turns out there’s quite a bit of truth to it…if you’re talking about the Atom.</short-description>
	<history>A gifted physicist, Dr. Ray Palmer put his genius mind to good use by laboring tirelessly to help create a better world. His hard work led to advancements in matter compression and the discovery of white-dwarf star remnants on Earth. Creating a specialized, size-changing belt that houses a lens filled with star matter, Ray has the ability to shrink his size down to subatomic levels. This unique power inspired his heroic moniker and allows the Atom to handle things most other heroes can’t even see: viruses, parasites, nuclear reactions and beyond. Using phone, fiber-optic cables and even the bloodstreams of other heroes and villains, Ray can get wherever he needs to be at incredible speeds.The Atom is constantly learning and has become a leading mind in some of the most progressive areas of scientific thought and inquiry. This thirst for knowledge has made him the go-to hero when facing problems rooted in science, but it can sometimes cloud his judgment when the enemy is powered by the supernatural or motivated by something that seems irrational. Ray can tackle the world’s biggest quandaries and tiniest threats, but there’s one fight he always struggles with: accepting that some things in life just can’t be explained.</history>

	<short-description>She rules the seas alongside Aquaman, one of the most well-known heroes in the world, and stands as one of the most powerful women in the DC Universe. Her name is Mera and you don't want to get on this quick-tempered beauty's bad side because she won't hesitate to kick your butt across all seven seas.</short-description>
	<history>A princess of the underwater kingdom of Xebel who possesses enhanced strength, durability and the ability to bend water to her will, Mera trained since birth for her ultimate mission: to kill the current King of Atlantis in retaliation for her people's exile. Mera knew that to do this, she’d have to gain Aquaman’s trust. It was the only way she could get close enough to kill him. But as she got to know Aquaman, something unexpected occurred—she fell in love. And thus began the fiery redhead's constantly conflicted sense of being. To stand beside her husband is to betray her family and her people, but to give them what they want, to fulfill her mission, is something her heart would never allow her to do.Although a hero in her own right, Mera often finds herself struggling between two worlds—whether it’s between her own people and her husband or between those of the surface and those of the sea. Her aggressive nature especially puts her at odds with the surface world, a world so much bigger and more complex than she was ever taught and with whom she finds it impossible to relate to and understand. It’s for her love of Aquaman that she even attempts to understand this world of man, and why she continues to try to be a part of both worlds while terrified of belonging to none.“The Drowning” part four.

	<short-description>Go ahead. Scream as loud as you can. Your loudest and most strenuous efforts won't come close to matching the pitch and ferocity of the Canary Cry. When was the last time you shattered something with your voice?</short-description>
	<history>One of DC Universe's earliest super heroines, the Black Canary mantle has been worn by a few different women across decades of appearances in comics, cartoon, TV shows and video games—but none is better known than Dinah Laurel Lance. Inspired by her father and his career in the Gotham City Police Department, Dinah wasn't able to join the force, but she found a different way of following in his crime fighting footsteps—as a black-clad, street smart vigilante.Driven to protect the streets and keep citizens safe in whatever city she calls home, Dinah has a fighter's spirit and determination. Her ultrasonic scream isn't the only ability that sets her apart as Black Canary, but it is her verbal calling card. She wields the noise with precision to crumble objects and incapacitate foes. A devoted student of martial arts and other methods of hand-to-hand combat, she is now a master and teaches what she's learned to up-and-coming super heroes. Dinah uses her impressive skills alongside her frequent and sometimes romantic partner Green Arrow, and she has proven herself to be a team player on multiple occasions—having worked with the Justice League of America and led her own team of Gotham-based heroes, the Birds of Prey.“The Death and Life of Oliver Queen” part four!“Who Is Oracle?” part one!

	<short-description>On one dark day, the planet wept as the World’s Greatest Super Hero fell. No one will ever forget the day that Superman died. Nor will they forget the name of the monster responsible—Doomsday. A creature whose rampage of destruction and violence could only be stopped when the Man of Steel made the ultimate sacrifice.</short-description>
	<history>Doomsday was originally created on Krypton as part of a deranged scientist's quest to create the perfect hunter. The creature was subjected to cruel and terrible experiments—killed and cloned thousands upon thousands of times—a process that allowed his body to adapt natural defenses against whatever previously had bested him. Through this sort of rapid evolution, Doomsday became an unstoppable, nearly indestructible creature of violence and death that knew only hate and sought to kill everything in its path.Doomsday possesses an immeasurable level of strength and invulnerability beyond those of even Superman.

	<short-description>Whether it’s the help he receives on the Gotham streets from Robin, Batgirl and Nightwing, the legitimacy provided to his crusade by Commissioner Gordon or the super-powered backup brought in by his colleagues in the Justice League, Batman has a lot of friends. But only one of them has stood alongside the Caped Crusader since childhood: his loyal butler, Alfred Pennyworth.</short-description>
	<history>Bruce’s life wasn’t the only one that was changed with the squeeze of that gunman’s trigger. A family friend and faithful butler, whose father had served as the Waynes’ butler before him, Alfred took on the responsibility of raising young Bruce after the murder of his parents. Caring deeply for the Wayne family, Alfred knew that the best way to honor the legacy of Thomas and Martha Wayne was ensuring their son grew into the man they would have wanted. He tried to mold the angry, confused boy into a savvy businessman who would be well-suited to take over his father’s business.But Bruce had a far different way of honoring his parents in mind, and when he adopted the cowl, Alfred came along for the ride, tirelessly guarding his employer’s secret while providing some much-needed assistance. Whether it’s skilled technical support, medical aid or simply managing the complicated schedule that comes with being a business leader, nighttime vigilante and wealthy playboy—it’s all under the purview of Mr. Pennyworth. Driven by love and an unwavering sense of loyalty, Alfred nevertheless worries deeply about Bruce. He understands the importance of Batman to a city such as Gotham, but after a lifetime of raising Bruce, he still sees a young, scared boy where most see a hardened hero. And every night the bat-signal flashes across the city skyline is another night that boy will spend searching for a way to undo something that could never be undone. A search that Alfred realizes could very well lead to his end.Superstar artist Jim Lee returns to the Dark Knight with this premiere issue, now presented in pencil form in this new DIRECTOR’S CUT Special!In the irreverent spirit of fun that made “The LEGO® Movie” a worldwide phenomenon, the self-described leading man of that ensemble – LEGO Batman – stars in his own big-screen adventure.

	<short-description>Through millions of years of adaptation and change, human beings evolved to become the dominant species on the planet Earth. But for the super-villain known as Grodd, the world shouldn't belong to the humans. It belongs to the apes.</short-description>
	<history>Hailing from the technologically advanced Gorilla City, home to hyper-intelligent primates living in their own secret, secluded society, Grodd stood apart from his fellow simians through his telepathic and telekinetic powers. Believing that his city’s benevolence was keeping the gorillas from achieving what was rightly theirs, Grodd overthrew the leader of Gorilla City and took his place—a first step in his ultimate goal of taking over the rest of the world and establishing apes as the ruling species on the planet. It was the intervention of the Flash that ultimately stopped the villain's scheme, and forever placed the two as bitter rivals.Grodd has a brutal nature and a level of enhanced strength that make him incredibility dangerous in a physical fight. This is presuming you're even able to get close enough to him to throw a punch as his powerful telepathic abilities give him a distinct advantage over most of his enemies. Along with his strength and aggression, Grodd is also highly intelligent and a master statistician. It is this perfect combination of brain, brawn and savagery that cements Grodd's conviction of his place at the top of the evolutionary scale. And anyone who challenges his claim, will find themselves learning the true meaning of survival of the fittest.Think the Flash can carry a tune? Well, we can't, but thanks to the wonders of autotune, we don't have to! In this DC All Access clip, we remix the first season of The Flash, reminding all of us that no matter what threats Barry Allen may face, he'll get through them provided he remembers to RUN..."I'm pretty sure one telepathic ape is more than enough for this city..." Season 2, Episode 7 of The Flash, "Gorilla Warfare," airs on Tuesday, November 17, 2015 on The CW.With Superman back at full power, he takes the fight right to Vandal Savage in the epic conclusion to "Savage Dawn"!WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! Don't touch that dial! Or clickpad, touchscreen, computer mouse... The point is, if you're a #DCTV fan, you're going to want to watch as DCAA's Jason Inman and Tiffany Smith break down last week's episodes of Gotham, The Flash, iZombie and Arrow and discuss the episodes...WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! Okay, can we all agree on one thing, here? Zoom is absolutely terrifying! Last week didn’t pull any punches as far as #DCTV is concerned, so why should this one be any different? In this exclusive DC All Access clip, Jason and Tiffany preview the week ahead, revealing...Tom Taylor (EARTH 2, Superior Iron Man) returns to the series he launched for this one time special event that kicks off the story you’ll see in the upcoming INJUSTICE: GODS AMONG US</history>

	<short-description>One is one of the greatest super heroes in the world—a legend whose symbol inspires hope and that stands as the embodiment of truth and justice. The other is one of the world's greatest villains—an egomaniacal genius whose every action only serves to further his own goals, even at the expense of others. What side of the coin do you fall? Good or evil? Alien or human? Superman or Lex Luthor?Maybe it's a little bit of both?</short-description>
	<history>Cloned from Kryptonian and human DNA, and gifted with powerful tactile telekinesis, Superboy possesses abilities similar to that of the Man of Steel. Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, Kon-El always strives to live up to the Superman name but constantly questions his ability to do so. Of course, having the shared DNA of Lex Luthor doesn't make it any easier on the young hero, who lives in constant fear of what sort of influence his human side might hide.Part alien, part human, he exists as a boy of both worlds—embracing aspects of both Kryptonian heritage and humanity in a way that Superman never can.“THE SON OF SUPERMAN” Chapter Two: In #2, Superboy takes flight as he accompanies his father, the Man of Steel, on their first mission together to confront a creature more dangerous After a stunning bank heist, the Amazing Mumbo Jumbo uses his magic to scramble the superpowers of the Teen Titans!Gone, but definitely not forgotten, the animated series Young Justice remains one of the most popular #DCTV shows of the past decade. With the holidays upon us and 2015 slowly drawing to a close, the time felt right to look back on this fan favorite and highlight out Top 10 Young Justice...It’s the 1990s epic in which Clark Kent and Lois Lane tied the knot, featuring stories and art by some of greatest Superman storytellers of all time!

	<short-description>Look! Up in the sky! It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It’s…Well, you know how it ends, don’t you? It’s a sentence so iconic, there are probably kids shouting it in Swahili as you read this.The most recognized superhero in pop culture, Superman has been elevated to mythic folkhero status. Rocketed to Earth from the dying planet Krypton, baby Kal-El was found by a farming couple who named the boy Clark Kent and raised him as their own. Discovering his enormous powers, they instilled in him strong moral values—and inspired him to become a hero.</short-description>
	<history>Superman has super-everything—strength, speed, flight, invulnerability as well as his renowned X-ray and heat vision. The most powerful being on the planet, his amazing abilities are also a melancholy reminder of how different he is from the people he’s dedicated to protect. A universal icon, Superman means different things to the many diverse people he inspires: He’s an alien; an immigrant from a faraway land just looking to help; a country boy fighting the never-ending battle for truth and justice. And recent comics have truly spotlighted his role as the people’s hero: Following a neophyte Man of Steel still learning his powers’ limits, Superman fights the evil corporate tycoons and corrupt one-percenters that have overwhelmed the establishment. “Made in China” part two! The New Super-Man must face off against the Justice League of China?“SON OF SUPERMAN” part five!

	<short-description>After gaining the ability to absorb heat from living beings and to project cold and ice, Caitlin Snow emerged a changed woman—and became the villain Killer Frost.Sociopathic by nature, Killer Frost’s icy exterior matches her chillingly cold interior. Militant and sadistic, she enjoys killing and feels no remorse when taking another’s life. Frost constantly finds herself at odds with the hero Firestorm, whose vast output of energy provides a massive power source for the villain. And when it comes to unlimited power, Frost will kill anyone in her way to get it.</short-description>
	<history>Killer Frost’s ability to figuratively and literally chill anyone to the bone and her wanton disregard of life make her an incredibly dangerous foe—one who not only wants to kill but also takes pleasure in doing so.Evil doppelgangers. Psychotic speedsters. Angry supervillains. Even the World's Fastest Man might have a hard time keeping up with all the action this season on The Flash. In this #DCTV clip, Tiffany pays a visit to the set of the hit CW show, getting the goods on what's ahead from stars Grant..."It's so much more fun to be bad."

	<short-description>Every kid wants to be Batman, but do you have a lifetime of training? A billion-dollar fortune? The dream gets dashed pretty quickly. So OK, maybe you can’t be Batman… but that doesn’t mean you can’t be adopted by him.And just like that, Robin the Boy Wonder made the kid sidekick an icon.</short-description>
	<history>Acrobat Dick Grayson was the youngest member of his parents’ death-defying circus act. But after their cold-blooded murder, Dick vowed revenge. Seeing a genuine piece of himself in the boy, Batman took him in—and gave him a better outlet for his anger. Becoming Batman’s protégé, Robin is an expert fighter and astounding acrobat—with the toughest example in the world to live up to. But the Boy Wonder’s true strength may lie in not being Batman—and providing a beacon of hope and family throughout the Dark Knight’s grim crusade.But as Dick matures into his own entity—eventually becoming the masked crime fighter Nightwing—Robin proves more than just an identity, but a mantle passed to the most worthy. From the troubled Jason Todd to the overachieving Tim Drake, the mask is now worn by Bruce Wayne’s own son Damian—a rebellious troublemaker who’s been trained by assassins since birth. With a lethal skill set and a marginal sense of mercy, Robin no longer needs Batman to protect him from criminals.“Rise of the Batmen” part five!

	<history>As CEO, Lucius presides over the strategy and management of Bruce Wayne's multi-billion dollar company, ensuring it remains profitable while remaining ethical. Very intelligent and with a knack for business that’s second to none, Lucius plays a crucial role in ensuring the financial security of the business, which allows Bruce to concentrate on his more nocturnally inclined activities as Batman. Whether or not Lucius is fully aware of his employer's vigilantism is unclear, but he has admitted that he prefers to retain a level of "plausible deniability." Regardless, Lucius does tend to allocate funds toward research and development projects that would be incredibly beneficial to the Dark Knight's cause.Lucius Fox's resourcefulness and business acumen place him alongside Alfred and Commissioner Gordon as a valuable asset to the Dark Knight, without whom Batman's success would be much more difficult to achieve…if not outright impossible.When Batman goes missing, it will take the entire Bat “family”—including new additions Batwoman and Batwing—to keep the peace in Gotham City and unravel the mystery behind the Dark KThe epic “Truth” arc reaches its finale as Superman discovers the true fate of Batman and makes a fateful decision.The Superman epic you never expected – “TRUTH” continues!

	<short-description>Imagine if the ring on your finger was more than a piece of gaudy jewelry. Instead, it’s the universe’s most powerful weapon. It can create whatever you wish out of pure energy, its might limited only by your imagination and will. And with it comes exclusive membership to an exclusive intergalactic police force with alien officers spanning the cosmos.</short-description>
	<history>The only catch? Mastering that power and being a Green Lantern means facing your fears, and for headstrong Hal Jordan, that’s something he’s been avoiding his whole life.When just a boy, Hal witnessed his greatest nightmare—his pilot father dying in a tragic plane crash. Nevertheless determined to follow in his footsteps, Hal repressed his fears, becoming a reckless, defiant test pilot. But when a dying alien crashes on Earth, the irresponsible Hal is chosen to be that alien’s successor in the Green Lantern Corps, a universe-wide peacekeeping force over 3,600 members strong.And his life only gets wilder from there. Alien romances. Intergalactic wars. Power-hungry super-villains. Wielding a Green Lantern power ring—a weapon fueled by willpower—he can fly and create constructs made of pure energy, generating anything from massive green fists to emerald rifles that can snipe from a planet away. But while Hal tends to ignore his fears, he’ll learn the only way to truly master his ring’s power is by confronting and overcoming them. “Sinestro’s Law” part two!A new menace rises to threaten the fragile order the Wonders struggle to maintain.Superstar artist Ethan Van Sciver returns to the world of Green Lantern!Earth-2’s Batman is Dick Grayson.

	<short-description>High school, dating, parents, acne, figuring out what you’re going to do with your life after graduation… Let’s face it, it’s stressful being a teenager. The urge to fit in and live a normal life free of embarrassment is overwhelming. So it’s a fair bet that being targeted by an alien artifact that resembles a big bug to become a super hero known as Blue Beetle probably wasn’t high on Jaime Reyes’ playlist.</short-description>
	<history>Jaime wasn’t much different than other teenagers. He wanted to fit in at school and perhaps gain a bit more attention from Brenda Del Vecchio, his feisty female friend. At home, he constantly wished he could do more to help his struggling family. But he got more responsibility than he ever dreamed possible the day an alien doomsday weapon known as the Blue Beetle scarab chose Jaime as its new guardian, gifting him with dangerous weaponry, full body armor and the power of flight.As if helming a weapon designed to force its wearer to conquer the planet wasn’t bad enough, his new power has quickly drawn a small army of equally powerful enemies that present a very real threat to Jaime and those he loves. But while tangling with Blood Beetle, La Dama and The Reach may not have been part of his plan, Jaime’s accepted that his powers can do a lot of good for his community and world…as long as he can keep his domineering new suit under control.Lost in the desert with no memory of the past few years, teenager Jaime Reyes must find his way home again—but when he reaches his town, he’s shocked to find it abandoned and in the The Teen Titans will square off against the Justice League in our next animated movie, but first they’ll both have to face DC All Access!

	<short-description>She's made countless comic book appearances since her debut in 1940's BATMAN #1. She's been portrayed by two Oscar-nominated actresses—Michelle Pfeiffer in Tim Burton's classic film "Batman Returns" and Anne Hathaway in director Christopher Nolan's critically acclaimed blockbuster "The Dark Knight Rises." And she's been featured in almost every Batman-related animated or video game incarnation.</short-description>
	<history>Indeed, Selina Kyle has led many lives as the feline fatale Catwoman—but one thing remains the same: Whenever this cat crosses your path, she's equally likely to steal your heart as well as your wallet.Growing up an orphan in one of Gotham’s worst neighborhoods, Selina turned to a life of crime to not only keep herself alive but her friends as well. The vivacious villainess elevated cat burglary to an art form, stealing whatever may be necessary—and sometimes even more—to survive and protect those closest to her. Utilizing a cat mask and suit to steal from the city’s rich and corrupt, she's a master at hand-to-hand combat and acrobatics, stealthy as a ninja and an expert at breaking and entering.However, despite her burglarious nature and antagonistic origins, Catwoman walks a fine line between hero and villain. She balances precariously on the precipice of good and evil, of doing the wrong thing for the arguably right reasons. And as such, Selina doesn't look at the world in black and white, but shades of gray. Guided by her own strict—if not slightly skewed—moral compass, Selina sometimes serves as one of the Dark Knight's closest allies.

	<short-description>As the Guardian of Gotham, Batman strikes fear into the hearts of his enemies—utilizing terror itself as a weapon in his crusade against the villains that plague his city. However, there is another denizen of Gotham that knows how to use fear to his advantage. One that turns Batman's own weapon against him and revels in terror and dread: the Scarecrow.</short-description>
	<history>As a young child, Jonathan Crane was subjected to sick and twisted experiments on fear conducted by his own father. Emotionally scarred and mentally unstable from the ordeal, Crane spent his childhood living in fear until he made an important realization—if he could control fear, it would never again control him. Over time, this interest in fear become an obsession. Graduating from college with a doctorate in psychology and specialty in phobias, Jonathan began experimenting on others, subjecting them to a hallucinogenic fear toxin he developed that brought out their worst nightmares. Although Batman has developed a number of remedies to counteract these toxins, Crane is constantly improving upon his formula, creating more potent and deadlier versions.The Scarecrow constantly proves to be a dangerous threat to the Dark Knight not due to physical strength, but to the emotional and psychological damage his toxins can cause. In fact, Scarecrow tends to shy away from physical confrontations and instead lets his victims fall prey to their own waking nightmares. A doctor of the deadliest caliber, the Scarecrow's horrific acts don't stem from a villainous desire for power or money, but from an unbreakable urge to learn and hone his craft—mastery over fear itself.Return to two of the greatest superhero games of all time - visually enhanced and recreated for a new generation in Batman: Return to Arkham.Includes Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City and all previously released DLC.Pre-order today:...It’s the catastrophic conclusion of the acclaimed weekly series that brings together all of Batman’s one-time partners!T.H.R.U.S.H.’s mysterious new leader puts Batman, Robin, Solo and Kuryakin in the ultimate death trap—a deserted island filled with deadly devices engineered by the likes of Poison IThe Caped Crusader and the Men From U.N.C.L.E. are on to the next big THRUSH operation—a heist in Europe.While Shredder enters an uneasy alliance with a deadly new partner, Casey Jones is arrested by the GCPD.It’s the catastrophic conclusion of the acclaimed weekly series that brings together all of Batman’s one-time partners!It’s part two of “Gotham Academy Yearbook”!

	<short-description>As a child, Garfield Logan contracted a rare illness that nearly killed him. It was only an untested serum administered by his parents that saved his life—and granted him an amazing ability that led to him becoming the shape-changing super hero known as Beast Boy.</short-description>
	<history>Beast Boy can transform into any animal he has seen—both in real life and in illustrations. Gorillas, rhinos, sharks and even dinosaurs are within his nimble reach. His powers allow him to alter his entire body mass, permitting him to morph into animals larger, smaller, lighter or heavier than himself. He can even radically alter his body structure to form beasts such as snakes, jellyfish or insects. While in animal form, Garfield retains his unusual skin coloration, however, he also gains the abilities of each animal, whether it’s the strength of a gorilla or the speed of a cheetah.Upbeat, flirtatious and a bit of a joker, Beast Boy retains an air of affability at almost all times. Quite a feat, considering the loss of his parents, his rough childhood under a foster father and the physical changes brought to his skin and hair color due to the serum. Although he often uses his humor to hide the emotional pain he suffered from these hardships, the bonds he’s formed with his fellow super heroes has lessened his pain, and he trusts and loves his friends completely.When H.I.V.E. threatens to destroy New Orleans, the city turns to the Teen Titans for help!

	<short-description>What are our best traits as humans? Our empathy? Our intelligence? Our respect for life and constantly striving to do right? It’s ironic, then, that within the DC Universe, very few people embody those very human traits quite as well as J’onn J’onzz, the Martian Manhunter.</short-description>
	<history>A former police officer and family man on his home planet of Mars, J’onn’s life was shaped by great tragedy after witnessing horrific fires that engulfed and destroyed his people and planet—leaving him the lone survivor of his race. Grieving for his family and world, J’onn made Earth his new residence, quickly becoming one of the universe’s most powerful protectors and a key asset for the JLA.Possessing a unique set of powers and abilities, Martian Manhunter rivals even Superman when it comes to his capabilities. Incredible strength, flight, shape-shifting, invisibility, telepathy, telekinesis, extensive wisdom, powerful optic blasts… Martian Manhunter is a force to be reckoned with. Yet for all of his power and wisdom, this near-immortal is still troubled by that which destroyed his world—fire. Though it continues to haunt him, he has learned to channel his fear and transform it into resilience, one of mankind’s greatest traits. Shaped by tragedy and driven by a desire to prevent his planet’s fate from happening to Earth, Martian Manhunter continues to prove that there’s much we can learn from this uniquely human hero.With the Living Mars and Earth only minutes away from an apocalyptic collision, the epic story of J’onn J’onzz takes a shocking turn that will change the course of the Manhunter’s li</history>

	<short-description>Death is only the beginning... Well, at least it is for murdered trapeze artist Boston Brand. Once a famed circus performer, Brand now walks the Earth between the realms of life and death as Deadman, tasked with discovering the truth of his murder and forced to help those destined to repeat his sins.</short-description>
	<history>Enthralled by fame and wealth, Boston Brand took his loyal family and friends for granted and wasted his skills with a shallow existence based on fortune and glory. But after his death, he was sentenced to a unique penance: a ghost charged with solving his own murder and preventing others from going down the same wrong path that he did.Deadman is able to possess any living person on the planet, inhabiting their bodies and inheriting all their skills. With a newfound perspective on his past, Deadman is increasingly compelled to help the living, forever leaping from body to body and showing others how to appreciate life in all the ways he failed to. Selfish and single-minded while alive, Boston Brand never learned to live until he died—moving through the lives of others, inhabiting their bodies, fixing their problems, and hopefully, atoning for his own sins in the process.Alec Holland journeys to Nanda Parbat to seek a way to fix the chaos he has unleashed by wishing for his humanity back.

	<short-description>Everyone can understand the fear of seeing your beliefs and ideals become twisted and deformed—of seeing everything you stand for reflected darkly back at you. Unfortunately for Superman, and the world itself, he experiences this very thing every single time he faces Bizarro.</short-description>
	<history>An imperfect clone of Superman, Bizarro possesses all of the hero's amazing abilities and none of his moral restraints. He stands for the exact opposite of everything Superman represents, a warped reflection of the Man of Steel's inherent heroism. The uncontrollable villain rampages through the world, causing mass devastation and destruction, his twisted perspective making him as committed to causing violence as Superman is to stopping it. His faulty logic, broken speech and backwards morality make him unable to see his actions as wrong. Instead, he whole-heartedly believes he is acting in the correct manner, and that it is the Man of Tomorrow who is committing the acts of villainy.Broken, but brutally violent and incredibly unpredictable, Bizarro is one of the world’s most dangerous threats—and a terrifying example of the destructive potential Superman holds.“Dark Trinity” part one!The tragicomic journey of Bizarro takes a dark turn. Guided by the Trickster, every attempt to do something good leads to something far, far worse.Deathstroke versus an army of Bizarros! As the battle within Lexcorp intensifies, the hunt for Slade’s missing daughter takes a surprising turn!When a shocking encounter with Batman solidifies the Red Hood’s status as a villain, Jason Todd goes deep undercover to take down Gotham City’s criminal underworld from the inside.Lex Luthor is determined to destroy Bizarro before Superman figures out that Lex created the murderous super-monster in the first place!A major rift develops between Batman and Catwoman as she questions how his use of villains in the Insurgency makes him any better than Superman.Killer Frost has Catwoman on ice, trying to coerce her into coming over to the side of the Regime.</history>

	<short-description>Love makes us do crazy things. And for the bubbly and psychotic Harley Quinn, that includes dressing in costume, becoming a super-villain, carrying gag-themed weaponry, and murdering countless civilians—all just to put a smile on her puddin's face.</short-description>
	<history>Before her descent into madness, Dr. Harleen Quinzel was a promising psychiatrist assigned to Arkham Asylum, Gotham's home for the criminally insane. But after meeting the Joker, the young doctor became obsessed with the crazed criminal's warped mind. Sensing opportunity, the Joker manipulated her, driving his therapist so mad that he was able to control her. Harleen fell in love with the villain, broke him out of Arkham and devoted her life to making him happy and spreading his bloody brand of mayhem.Athletic, agile and dangerously unpredictable in a fight, Harley Quinn is a formidable opponent in her own right.

	<short-description>Gotham City's Police Department doesn't exactly have a reputation for excellence, but that doesn't mean Batman's home is without good cops. It’s just that in a city like Gotham, to uphold the law, you sometimes have to be willing to break it.</short-description>
	<history>At least, that’s how Detective Harvey Bullock sees it. A good cop worn down by the corruption of Gotham, Bullock may appear slovenly or even oafish, but don’t be fooled. He’s a smart man, dedicated to solving crimes. He just knows that in this city, sometimes to solve a crime you need to cross the line. Whether it’s taking a bribe, roughing up a perp or forging ties with organized crime, Bullock is more than willing to bend the rules to keep the people of Gotham safe and put the truly dangerous criminals behind bars.Even though he may operate in a decidedly gray area, Bullock has righteous intentions. He's loyal to the job and Commissioner Gordon, and has a begrudging respect for Batman. Bullock's willingness to push the boundaries of ethics in favor of getting results to benefit the greater good has proven effective, but it's dangerous territory. He must exercise caution to ensure he doesn't go too far and lose his way. Otherwise, this cop, who has devoted his life to upholding the law, may just find himself on the wrong side of it.Batman has returned to Gotham City! In this extra-sized conclusion to Snyder and Capullo’s epic story “Superheavy,” Bruce Wayne returns to the cape and cowl to battle Mr.The epic “Death of the Family” begins in this story, reprinted for just $1.00 from BATMAN #13, with pages from the 2016 edition of the DC ESSENTIALS CATALOGUE! It's a whole new season of #DCTV!

	<short-description>Some men want to watch the world burn. Mick Rory wants to light the match himself.As a young child, Rory was fascinated with fire, entranced by the flames as they danced and glowed. However, fascination quickly turned into obsession, and Rory set fire to his family's farmhouse...with them still inside, watching as the flames engulfed everything. As he grew older, his obsession grew stronger and he continued to set fires wherever he went.</short-description>
	<history>After getting to know many of the other villains of Central City and seeing how they operated, Rory created a fireproof suit and handgun-size flamethrower capable of reaching extreme levels of heat. With these, Rory moved from a simple arsonist to a super-villain—Heat Wave. Although he faced the Flash a number of times on his own, Heat Wave eventually joined the ranks of Captain Cold's Rogues, quickly becoming one of the criminal organization’s most prominent members.Heat Wave is capable of creating flames so hot that he can instantaneously reduce anything flammable around him to ash and liquefy metal. He works regularly with the Rogues, but unlike the other members of the group who follow a code, Heat Wave's only goal is to watch things burn—making him the most disturbed and dangerous of all the Rogues.</history>

	<short-description>Having a cold heart doesn't mean you're incapable of feeling love. Just ask Victor Fries. His is a sad tale of loss, obsession and villainy.An expert in the field of cryogenics, Victor led a relatively normal existence. He worked diligently, but also fell in love with and eventually married a woman named Nora. Sadly, things took an unfortunate turn soon after. Nora became terminally ill, and to stop her degenerative disease from taking her life, Victor put her into suspended animation. His devotion to Nora led to his downfall.</short-description>
	<history>The corporation funding Victor's work shut down his experiments and, in the process, caused a horrible accident, errantly releasing coolants in his lab that did irreparable harm to Victor's body’s chemistry. Transforming the former Dr. Fries into an ice-colored monstrosity, the coolants made it impossible for him to survive above freezing temperatures. To counteract this, Victor constructed a special, ultra-durable suit to keep his body alive and at the right temperature. He embraced his new persona and became Mr. Freeze.Mr. Freeze is on a constant quest to bring back his beloved Nora, and he'll do whatever it takes to succeed. He wields a freeze gun and uses ice and cold to wreak havoc—mostly in Gotham and against Batman, but he'll turn his chill upon anyone standing in his way.Return to two of the greatest superhero games of all time - visually enhanced and recreated for a new generation in Batman: Return to Arkham.Includes Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City and all previously released DLC.Pre-order today:...The crossover event of the year comes to its thrilling conclusion.

	<short-description>An assassin, expert marksman and lethal DC Universe villain, Floyd Lawton lives by a simple code: do the job that you're hired for with the least amount of casualties possible—after all, you're not being paid to waste bullets.</short-description>
	<history>Part of Gotham City's long line of rogues, Deadshot is obsessed with precision, firmly believing that the target who’s been paid for should be the only one taken down. In the midst of a successful career, Lawton was taken down by the Dark Knight and sentenced to life in prison for the countless assassinations he committed. However, a man of Lawton's skills earns a reputation.Given a chance to earn his freedom, Deadshot joined the Suicide Squad—a team of villains recruited by Amanda Waller to carry out covert (and highly illegal) missions. Often the de facto leader of the team, Deadshot always aims to complete the mission at hand... even if it kills him.Along with his ability to "never miss" his target, Deadshot possesses an unfulfilled death wish. He cares less about earning his freedom than he does about dying in a spectacular fashion. His reasons for this are unknown—many speculating family upbringing, loss of a loved one or simply not having anything left to live for. However, this complete disregard for his own life, along with his commitment to the job, make Deadshot one of the most dangerous assassins in the world.Soldier. War hero. Traitor. Captain Rick Flag was one of America’s greatest military commanders before he was banished to a secret military prison.When a retired American politician is taken to Europe and tried for alleged war crimes, the USA must recover him from an allied nation before terrible truths are revealed.Worst.

	<short-description>When it comes to Batman's greatest allies, Commissioner James Gordon easily ranks as one of the Dark Knight's oldest, most important, and most well known—sharing the Caped Crusader's commitment to ridding Gotham City of corruption and crime.</short-description>
	<history>Debuting alongside Batman in the pages of DETECTIVE COMICS #27, Commissioner Gordon has appeared in virtually every incarnation of the franchise and in every single form of media. An expert detective as well as a highly trained and decorated officer, as Commissioner of the GCPD, Gordon brought a dose of integrity and honesty to a previously fully corrupt police force. Under his leadership, the GCPD has improved both in the public eye and in their record of successful arrests and incarcerations. However, Gotham is no ordinary city, and where others may have locked up an unsanctioned super hero like Batman for taking the law into his own hands, Gordon has chosen to support the Dark Knight, acknowledging the difference he makes. Gordon's cooperation with Batman has made a difference in a city once seen as being well past the point of saving, and it’s sent a message to criminals throughout Gotham—whether it’s at the hands of a badge or a Bat, you will see justice. Gordon is aware of the legal issues associated with his partnership with the Dark Knight. As such, he adopts a "look the other way" philosophy for most of Batman's activities. Whereas Batman works in darkness as Gotham's Dark Knight, Commissioner James Gordon is its knight in the spotlight—ever vigilant and open about his commitment and desire to do what is right to protect and serve the people of his city.“I AM GOTHAM” Chapter OneThis free, stand-alone catalog features the first look at the upcoming DC UNIVERSE: REBIRTH.</history>

	<short-description>Once Krypton’s greatest military leader, General Dru-Zod was banished to the Phantom Zone for crimes he committed against the people of Krypton.

	<history>Like all Kryptonians, Zod gains an array of powers after exposure to Earth’s yellow sun—including, but not limited to, super-strength, flight, super-speed, invulnerability, heat vision and x-ray vision. Beyond his physical abilities, Zod also possess a dangerously intelligent mind with a gift for strategy.A leader by nature, Zod tends give orders on the battlefield rather than jumping directly into the midst of it, using his subordinates to take down his enemies.

	<short-description>Cities can be hard, crowded places full of people with different interests, backgrounds and points of view. Voices go unheard and attempts to make a difference often feel pointless. Unless we’re talking about Gotham, in which trying to do good isn’t just fruitless—it’s dangerous.</short-description>
	<history>A prominent and well-educated District Attorney, Harvey Dent fought valiantly to uphold the law and make the city a better place. In any other city, it would have worked. Not in Gotham—a place where greed and corruption stretches from the depths of Crime Alley to the shimmering heights of the mayor’s office. Dent’s spiral into Gotham’s madness came swiftly after a criminal threw acid into his face, leaving half of it horribly scarred. Seeking refuge in the underbelly of Gotham, the name Harvey Dent and all the good it stood for was lost…and Two-Face rose from the darkness.      Armed with a set of .22 calibers, superior intellect and deep knowledge of criminal law, Two-Face is entranced by the idea of chance—making most of his decisions based on the outcome of a coin toss. Capable of orchestrating and carrying out well-organized, large-scale criminal operations, he makes sure the city’s streets continue to run red with blood. He’s unpredictable, and serves as a reminder of Gotham’s perpetual ability to corrupt and destroy all who seek to do good within it.Return to two of the greatest superhero games of all time - visually enhanced and recreated for a new generation in Batman: Return to Arkham.Includes Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City and all previously released DLC.Pre-order today:...Ten years after an aging Batman retired, Gotham City has sunk deeper into decadence and lawlessness in the opening chapter of Frank Miller’s classic tale of the Dark Knight!It is time.

	<short-description>The adage tells us that knowledge is power. If that truly is the case, then the entity known as Brainiac is on his way to becoming the most powerful being in the universe.</short-description>
	<history>Cold, calculating, unfeeling and absolutely single-minded in his goals, the aptly nicknamed Collector of Worlds journeys across the universe gathering information and knowledge from every civilization he encounters. But enlightenment isn’t Brainiac’s goal. Instead, he seeks the superiority that comes with knowledge. But what power does knowledge truly hold if everyone can obtain it? While more benevolent minds might be content to learn and share new knowledge, when Brainiac encounters a new civilization, he captures and bottles entire cities full of people and technology as samples—before destroying the planet and moving on, leaving little more than rubble in his wake.Brainiac is vastly intelligent and driven by pure, unwavering logic. Superman must utilize all of his powers when battling against the villain and his army of robot drones, but any chance at defeating Brainiac requires brains as well as brawn…and outthinking, out-planning and outwitting one of the smartest beings in the universe is a task few heroes are up to.Brainiac's power and intelligence make him one of Superman’s most dangerous foes—both as a direct threat and as a constant reminder to the entire world of just how big a danger an alien presence can truly be.In LEGO® DC Comics Super Heroes – Justice League: Cosmic Clash, the brilliant, hyper-obsessive-compulsive, super-computer Brainiac is combing theMultiverse beware—because Telos and Parallax have formed a catastrophic alliance that could change the DC Universe as we know it!Brainiac sends Superman, Wonder Woman and Green Lantern on an unplanned trip through time in this new LEGO DC Comics Super Heroes - Justice League: Cosmic Clash clip.Justice League: Cosmic Clash is the latest in the series of LEGO DC Comics Super Heroes full length...The Justice League unites to defeat the obsessive compulsive collector of worlds known as Brainiac in the newest LEGO DC Comics Super Heroes movie, Justice League: Cosmic Clash.Justice League: Cosmic Clash is the latest in the series of LEGO DC Comics Super Heroes full...Brainiac encounters Earth's powerful "firewall defense"—the Justice League—in this new LEGO DC Comics Super Heroes – Justice League: Cosmic Clash clip.Justice League: Cosmic Clash is the latest in the series of LEGO DC Comics Super Heroes full length animated movies and...Trapped deep underground on the planet Colu, Telos has the data he came for, and he’s ready to fight his way out.</history>

	<short-description>The speed of a cheetah. The charging force of a bull. The ferocity of a tiger. The strengths, abilities and attributes of the entire animal kingdom are at the beck and call of Mari McCabe—who channels these powers through a magical family heirloom to battle those who would harm the natural world as the super hero Vixen.</short-description>
	<history>As a child, Mari saw the greed and corruption that she fights against lead to the deaths of her parents. Later, Mari discovered that the mysterious Tantu Totem—the powerful necklace she inherited from her parents—granted her the ability to take on the attributes of every animal on Earth. She could fly like a hawk, breathe underwater like a fish and even strengthen her skin to the protective levels of a rhinoceros. Adopting the moniker Vixen, Mari seeks to protect and defend all innocents, humans and animals alike.Although short-tempered and sometimes overly self-righteous, Mari possesses compassion that gives her a strong and unwavering moral compass. Beyond her role as a super hero, she is a model and animal-rights activist, allowing her to use both aspects of her life to protect from humanity those creatures unable to protect themselves. Throughout her career as Vixen, she's fought along some of the greatest heroes in the DC Universe and has even served as a member of the Justice League.See exclusive trailers for The Flash and Arrow after the season finale of Vixen this Tuesday, September 29th on CW Seed: bit.ly/vixen106For more on Vixen: http://www.dccomics.com/tv/vixenDC All Access is back and better than ever!

	<short-description>Other people may see Superman as the greatest hero the world has ever known—a benevolent being with tremendous power, a strange visitor here to help. But one man sees him as something else entirely: a threat—a creature whose very existence hinders humanity, preventing it from ever reaching its true potential.</short-description>
	<history>A self-made man whose immeasurable intellect is always in conflict with his equally immeasurable ego, Lex Luthor is one of the world's most brilliant minds and most famous villains. From a young age, Lex utilized his almost unparalleled acumen to build himself a financial empire through hard work and dedication—but mainly through the strategic use of intimidation, bribery and murder. Sacrificing other people became simply a means to an end on the path to success, but Luthor always made sure none of his deplorable acts could be traced back to him. Instead, his climb to power and rise in status made him someone to look up to, someone people wanted to emulate—and he relished in the adoration.Until it all changed the day Superman appeared and gave the world something else to aspire to.Driven by jealousy masked with hate over what he perceives to be his stolen place as humanity's true savior, Luthor constantly attempts to destroy and humiliate Superman at every possible opportunity. He's willing to lie, cheat, steal, manipulate and go to any extreme necessary to accomplish his goals, not caring one bit about who he hurts. He is a man who not only wants to be seen as a god, but who has convinced himself he's the only one this worlds needs.“PATH TO DOOM” Chapter Three: Clark Kent gets caught in the crossfire as Doomsday crashes through the streets of Metropolis!Superman and the New Gods launch their plan to free the young boy and his dog from his Apokolips prison, but Darkseid’s ultimate prize is within sight, and the only person standing i“PATH TO DOOM” Chapter One“PATH TO DOOM” Chapter TwoThis free, stand-alone catalog features the first look at the upcoming DC UNIVERSE: REBIRTH.</history>

	<short-description>Riddle us this: what cerebral criminal with an affinity for purple and green loves challenging the Dark Knight with cleverly calculated crimes and puzzling plots?</short-description>
	<history>One of the Dark Knight's most infamous villains, Edward Nygma enjoys flaunting his intellectual superiority by conducting crimes and leaving clues for Batman to piece together. While this habit constantly leads to the aptly named Riddler failing in his criminal endeavors, his puzzle-problem actually stems not only from his own narcissism and ego, but also from a deep-seeded psychological compulsion. Because of this, the Riddler often finds himself a resident of Arkham Asylum following his inevitable capture.Possessing a genius-level intellect, the Riddler creates elaborate, sometimes Rube Goldberg-esque traps, and is even willing to use innocent civilians as bait. Although not physically imposing, the Riddler's brilliance, neurosis and lack of empathy make him an incredibly dangerous foe. He cares very little—if at all—about the lives of those he uses in his plots and instead only sees them as disposable pawns in his continuing intellectual battle against Batman.The Riddler has seized control of Central City. If The Flash moves, he’ll put everyone he loves in mortal danger.It's a big turning point for the Secret Six and all of their friends are attending the party. It's Strix versus Shiva! The Six versus the League of Assassins!</history>

	<short-description>You’ve just committed the crime of the century. You stand to gain millions. But someone’s on your trail. A shape-shifting superhero who’s infiltrated your quarters and masquerading as something in your very room. But what? The brown chair sitting by the window? The desk propping up your computer? Or could it possibly be the gaudy red and yellow chandelier no one in their right mind would ever buy?</short-description>
	<history>Pop culture’s silliest superhero, Plastic Man is as much a humor icon as a heroic one.  During a heist gone wrong, petty crook Patrick “Eel” O’Brian was doused in chemicals, allowing him to stretch his body into any shape he desires. Nursed back to health by altruistic monks, he was inspired to embrace life’s brighter side.Taking their ideals... maybe one step too far, Eel abandoned crime, becoming the pun-dropping, wise-cracking Plastic Man. Able to morph into anything—a table, a countertop, even a woman’s dress—he can bounce, stretch, and repel any foe. No weapon as sharp as his wit, he’ll introduce jocular justice to humanity’s darker side as the premiere amalgam of humor, action, and heroism.Tom Taylor (EARTH 2, Superior Iron Man) returns to the series he launched for this one time special event that kicks off the story you’ll see in the upcoming INJUSTICE: GODS AMONG USThe largest battle in the history of the Multiverse is here!STARRING HEROES FROM CRISIS ON INFINITE EARTHS!

	<short-description>For the men and women who earn their keep capturing intergalactic criminals and wrongdoers, life throughout the universe is cheap. But that doesn’t mean there’s not good money to be made in the taking of it, and when it comes to killing, there are few better than Lobo—the most brutally effective bounty hunter in the galaxy.</short-description>
	<history>Lobo was born on the utopian planet of Czarnia. Unfortunately for them, the foul-mouth brawler’s idea of a perfect world is one covered in bruises and blood. He wiped out his entire civilization and made himself the last of his people. Considering his name means "he who devours your entrails and thoroughly enjoys it" in his native tongue, perhaps they shouldn’t have been too surprised. Lobo took his predilection for murder and mayhem along with his rocket-fueled motorcycle and went on to become the best bounty hunter in the galaxy.Lobo looks out for himself first and foremost, and is never without a plan to cash in at other people’s expense. Though he’s glad to use weapons, Lobo doesn't really need them. His super-strength means his fists are made for bashing. Couple that with his advanced healing powers and unquenchable thirst for blood, and he’s proven to be an incredibly difficult foe to stop—unless you can trick him into entering into a deal. Mercenary or not, Lobo always keeps his word…though he’s not above getting creative in his interpretation of “true to his promise.” As an intergalactic bounty hunter, Lobo's gigs take him all over the universe, but he never lingers for long because there's always someone or something else to apprehend, preferably as painfully as possible.This free, stand-alone catalog features the first look at the upcoming DC UNIVERSE: REBIRTH.This epic tale from another era in Clark and Bruce’s history continues! Someone has put a bounty on Batman’s head, and Lobo’s come to collect.Exposed to a new, toxic alien drug, Lobo deals with its effects on his mind—while facing renegade Green Lantern Hal Jordan at the same time! FINAL ISSUEAfter falling victim to a deadly new drug that’s making its way through the black markets of the universe, Lobo begins to doubt his own sanity!With Superman back at full power, he takes the fight right to Vandal Savage in the epic conclusion to "Savage Dawn"!On a mission from Sinestro, Lobo hunts the last of the Red Lanterns—but will his involvement reignite the rage that fuels this deadly corps?</history>

	<short-description>When time itself is in danger, it takes a master to save it. Enter Rip Hunter. He’s part of the legion of Time Masters that patrol and protect the timestream from those who would warp or change history to their benefit, while also guarding the secrets of the Multiverse.</short-description>
	<history>Little is known about the origins of Rip Hunter, a time traveler from the distant future who appears during major events and works behind the scenes to ensure the safety of the space-time continuum. Throughout time, this enigmatic hero has teamed up with numerous members of the DC Universe—including the Justice League—in order to fix and maintain critical points in history.The creator of the Time Sphere, which allows its user to travel to and from any point in time, Hunter possesses a genius-level intellect and fighting skills from every era of history. However, Hunter's greatest asset remains his knowledge of historical events and their importance. He also keeps his real name and origin a mystery: the less known about him, the less likely another, more malevolent time traveler can go back in time and kill Hunter as a baby. As such, Hunter works just as hard to keep his true identity a secret as he does preserving time, our most precious resource.</history>

	<short-description>If it’s hard being a super hero, what is it like as a sidekick? The heroes get the glory, while you clean up the mess. You don’t make the decisions and you don’t give orders. So, what do you do if you’re the Boy Wonder to one of the most recognizable super heroes in the universe and you’re looking to break out on your own?Simple. You become Nightwing.</short-description>
	<history>When his circus acrobat family was brutally murdered, Dick Grayson was taken in by billionaire and bat-friendly super hero Bruce Wayne. Bruce shared his secret life as Batman with the young boy and eventually molded him into Robin—the Dark Knight’s partner in Gotham. But as Dick grew older, playing second fiddle to the sternest hero in the Justice League began to wear on him, and eventually he struck out on his own, staying true to what he learned as Robin while coming into his own as a respected member of the super hero pantheon. His code, like his mentor’s, is simple—if you’re breaking the law on his turf, watch out. Anyone who doesn’t can expect a short and most assuredly painful trip to Arkham.Yet, while he may share methods and motivation with Batman, Dick knows what being Batman can do. He doesn’t want to become as dark, controlling and lonely as Bruce. But for all the good he’s accomplished while avoiding it, one question is unavoidable—without going as far as Batman, can Nightwing be as effective as he ultimately wants to be?“Better than Batman” part two! Nightwing and his new mentor Raptor embark on their first assignment for the Parliament of Owls.“Remember the Titans” part two!After an old ally returns to the team, the Titans set their sights on a dangerous enemy with the power to change reality itself!He’s been Robin, Batman, a spy, a ghost. Now, Dick Grayson returns to Gotham City to reclaim the life that was taken from him.“Better than Batman” part three!“BETTER THAN BATMAN” Chapter One: Batman taught Nightwing everything he knows—but what if everything he taught him is wrong?It’s Damian at the crossroads when he must make a final, fateful choice between his biological father—Batman—and his current father figure, Superman.Batman has opposed Superman’s Regime since the beginning, while Damian (now Nightwing) threw his support behind the Man of Steel. Father and son, on opposite sides.</history>

	<short-description>To some, revenge is a dish best served cold. But for the Red Lantern Atrocitus, it’s best served with fire, blood and an unprecedented amount of rage.</short-description>
	<history>Millions of years ago, the Guardians of the Universe created the robotic Manhunters as their intergalactic peacekeeping force. But after a programming glitch, the Manhunters rampaged through Space Sector 666, eradicating almost all life—including those of Atrocitus' wife and children, who died brutally before his eyes. One of the massacre’s few survivors, Atrocitus swore revenge against the Guardians. But despite his considerable strength, skill and efforts, he was captured and imprisoned by the Guardians as they hid their horrendous mistake from the universe.Locked away for years, all that kept him alive was his hatred, until at last it consumed him. Atrocitus harnessed the red energy of rage and through blood rituals forged a Power Battery, creating the Red Lantern Corps. With a veritable army at his command, Atrocitus seeks his revenge—intent on killing every last one of the Guardians and willing to cut down any force that stands in his path of vengeance.“Red Planet” part five!“RED PLANET” Chapter OneAfter falling victim to a deadly new drug that’s making its way through the black markets of the universe, Lobo begins to doubt his own sanity!Lobo is finally face-to-face with Sinestro!

	<short-description>As a teenager, Maxwell Lord arrived home to find his father murdered. Convinced his successful father's powerful business associates were responsible, Lord became sure of one thing that day: power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. When those with super-powers began to appear, Lord believed this philosophy extended to them as well and quickly grew to mistrust them. Those with super powers will always abuse that power—hero or villain, it doesn’t matter.</short-description>
	<history>As he grew older, Lord became a shrewd businessman that favored government oversight and Big Brother-like politics over super hero vigilantism. His disdain toward those with super powers led to him growing more and more ruthless and manipulative, and eventually he helped form the Justice League International. He believed that the best way to watch over super heroes was to control them, and that he was the only man trustworthy enough and capable enough for the job. With this power, Lord grew to become one of the greatest threats to the DC Universe. Eventually he gained mind-control capabilities, and once even took control of the Man of Steel himself, sending Superman on a rampage.Maxwell Lord’s ability to control another person's mind extends far beyond the capabilities of most with similar powers, going so far as being able to maintain control after an individual realizes they are being controlled. However, the more he uses his powers, the greater the toll on his body—ranging from a simple nosebleed to, possibly, a fatal brain hemorrhage. Despite the countless lives he's taken in his quest to rid the world of super-powered individuals, Lord sees himself as the real hero. Because in his mind—ironically twisted and corrupted by power—they are the real threat, not him.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! Okay, can we all agree on one thing, here? Zoom is absolutely terrifying!

	<short-description>Life is full of positive and negative forces that keep each other in balance. Without both, our very existence would become unstable, our universe would collapse, and all life as we know it would end. No one wants this—no human or animal, no hero or villain. No one, that is, except for the Anti-Monitor.</short-description>
	<history>When the Multiverse was in its infancy, a disruption in its development resulted in the birth of two beings—the Monitor and the Anti-Monitor. The Anti-Monitor first made his home in the Antimatter Universe, but once he conquered all of it, he set his sights on the rest of the Multiverse.A monstrous being—both physically and mentally—the Anti-Monitor is one of the strongest and most savage villains mankind has ever faced. He’s capable of consuming both antimatter and positive matter, making and unmaking matter at will, all while altering reality and augmenting his own powers. Commanding an army of “shadow demons,” destructive warriors of pure antimatter that are loyal only to him, the Anti-Monitor has single-handedly destroyed thousands of universes. He takes lives by the millions and very few can stand in his way. Those who have, including our greatest super heroes, have met defeat and even death. If you see the Anti-Monitor coming, turn and run, because you don’t have much time… The epic “Darkseid War” continues as the League is forced to unite with their evil counterparts, the Crime Syndicate, to defeat the nigh-omnipotent Anti-Monitor!“Darkseid War” rages on!

	<short-description>She’s perhaps the greatest reporter on the planet. And not just the Daily Planet! Since her first appearance in Action Comics #1, Lois Lane has found herself at the center of one earth-shattering event after another. From her early days reporting on the plights of the common man and taking on the mob to her later adventures uncovering mole-men or covering Doomsday’s rampage through her beloved Metropolis, she’s done whatever it takes to get the story. Even when it puts her in danger.</short-description>
	<history>Of course, whenever she does find herself in harm’s way with no way out, Superman is there to save her. Because while she may have spent years trying to beat her colleague Clark Kent to get the byline, she’s also spent those same years in one of the great love stories for the ages. The tale of the god who loved a mortal is as timeless as mythology itself, but Superman and Lois gave it a 20th Century spin that still resonates into the 21st. A role model, an icon and a hero without a cape, Lois Lane has been an eyewitness to history, and through her perseverance and reporting, has opened hearts and minds—not the least of which belongs to the Man of Steel. Love may sometimes have blinded her to the obvious, that Clark and Superman are one and the same. But it’s that same love that has continued to be one of the greatest sources of strength for Kal-El, by helping him to become the most human alien.“Who Is Superwoman?” part one! Lois Lane takes flight! Now powered up with the abilities of Superman, Lois pledges to carry on the super-legacy as Superwoman!“PATH TO DOOM” Chapter Three: Clark Kent gets caught in the crossfire as Doomsday crashes through the streets of Metropolis!The world needs a Man of Steel, but can Superman protect the world while raising a super-son with his wife, Lois Lane?</history>
