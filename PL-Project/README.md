# PL-Project
<h1>Text Processing and Language Design</h1>
The first project contains a set of exercices that extract information from XML and text files using Flex, store and reorganize that information in C data structures and then expose that information in the fanciest way possible. The second one using Flex and Yacc we designed a Simple Imperative Programming Language, and create semantic actions to generate the correspondent assembly code.
