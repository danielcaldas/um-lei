## *They say you learn from your mistakes, well.. here they are*

In this repository I have stored all my projects of 3+2 years in software engineering at University of Minho. I also some some aside
coding challenges that I did along the way.

### Bachelor in Informatics Engineering

#### 1st year
- **Easy-C-Challenges** - Some basic basic challenges I did when starting to learn the C language.
- **C-Health-Calculator** - Me going all healthy in C.
- **Haskell-Exercises** - Some Haskell exercises, go functional.
- **LI-I-OLX-Uminho** - A web auctions system in Haskell.
- **megastring-C-Library** - Small library that contain some very useful C functions.
- **LI-II-Protein-Command-Prompt** - A command line prompt to play with proteins.

#### 2nd year

- **data-compression-software** - A generic data compressor built in the C language.
- **SO-Project** - Operative Systems class project, a multiprocess voting system.
- **LI-III-Gestauts** - Managing a collection of author with a modular approach in the C language.
- **POO-Fitness-UM** - Building a fitness system strictly following OO basic principals with the Java language.
- **Hello-Python** - Some exercises to get me into the Python programming language.
- **CodeWeek-Train-Challenge** - Annual programming challenge to make trains of words.

#### 3rd year
- **BD-Project** - Databases project, MySQL stuff.
- **DSS-Project** - A management software tool for a local NGO.
- **SD-Project** - Distributed Systems class project where we built a multithreaded warehouse in Java.
- **CC-Project** - Music Quiz build in Java, did some low level network work with UDP packages.
- **CG-Project** - Built some basic stuff with OpenGL.
- **LI-IV-Project** - An interactive Portuguese history tutor built in Microsoft .NET stack.
- **PL-Project** - Languages Processing projects.
- **SRCR-Project** - Some logic programming challenges with the PROLOG programming language, also had opportunity to
play around with neural networks, using R language and [nnet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nnet/index.html).

### Master's Degree in Applications Engineering and Knowledge and Language Processing

#### 1st year

- **[ProxyPrint](https://github.com/ProxyPrint)** - ProxyPrint is a platform where both printshops and regular consumer can use. In other words, one has access (within ProxyPrint) to all printshops registered there, which means one's not only able to make requests online (having to collect them physically afterwards) but can also compare the cost of his printing request across all printshops.

- **[snmp-ip-monitor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYjA4TGCic8)** - NodeJS server for reading MIB values and send it via WS to a simple html page. [See for yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYjA4TGCic8).

- **GAMu** - A web app built in LAMP stack to manage music schools and generate music auditions detailed flyers.

- **DC Universe** - DC Universe is a web app where you can navigate in the DC Comics Universe in an interactive way. I used a MEAN stack, OWL ontology for data representation, SPARQL for querying the ontology and Perl language to code a small web crawling module
to extract data from http://www.dccomics.com/ DC comics web site.

#### 2nd year
- MSc Thesis - @TODO
